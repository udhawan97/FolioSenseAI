"""Desktop entry point for the packaged FolioOrb app.

Runs the existing FastAPI application in-process on a loopback port and shows it
in a native window (WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows) via pywebview.
Closing the window shuts the server down. This is the target frozen by
PyInstaller — the browser-launching ``run.py`` remains the source/dev entry.

Run with ``--smoke`` to boot the server, confirm ``/health``, print the version,
and exit 0. CI uses this on the frozen binary to prove the bundle actually
starts before an installer is ever published.
