"""
Regression test: get_fast_quote must cache its full-quote fallback under the fast key.

When fast_info carries no usable price, get_fast_quote falls back to get_stock_data.
Previously the fallback result was never stored under the ``fast:`` cache key, so every
dashboard valuation refresh re-ran the fast_info network call for that ticker. The
fallback must now be cached so a second call is a pure cache hit.

No real network calls — yfinance's fast_info is faked.
