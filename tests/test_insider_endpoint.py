"""The insider-activity endpoint is a thin, lazy wrapper over the service.

Like move-explanation it is per-ticker and user-initiated, so it may spend the
EDGAR round trips the batch paths avoid. The endpoint itself holds no logic
worth duplicating — these tests pin the contract: it passes the ticker through,
returns the service payload, and never raises for a ticker with no insiders.
