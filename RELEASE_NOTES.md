# FolioOrb v5.6.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 17, 2026

## Headline

FolioOrb now reads a company from the inside out — what its insiders are doing,
what it actually earns, and what it pays you — all from primary sources that are
public, keyless, and free.

## What's New

### 🕵️ Insider activity, straight from Form 4

Expand any stock and see recent open-market buys and sells by the company's own
officers and directors, pulled from SEC Form 4 filings. Only open-market trades
count as conviction: option exercises, grants, gifts, and tax withholding are
shown for completeness but never folded into the buy/sell headline, because they
aren't decisions to buy or sell at the market. Funds and ETFs have no insiders,
so they say so. Every row links to the filing on `sec.gov`.

### 📊 Financials over time

The same expanded view now charts revenue, net margin, and diluted EPS by fiscal
year, from the numbers a company actually filed (SEC XBRL). Revenue bars scale to
the window's own peak so the trend reads at a glance. A metric a company didn't
file shows an em dash, never a fabricated zero, and the revenue history stitches
across the GAAP tag change most large filers made around 2018.

### 💵 What your holdings pay you

A new Analytics card turns each holding's forward dividend rate into annual cash
at your position size, totals it, and shows the blended yield across your payers.
Holdings that pay nothing are named, never counted as $0 income. Each payer shows
its yield and an ex-dividend heads-up when a payment's cutoff date is near.

### 🏷️ Filings in plain English

The filings timeline now labels each 8-K by what it reports — "Results announced,"
"Officer or director change," "Shareholder vote" — instead of raw item codes.

## Fixed

### 🛡️ Dividend yields read 100× too high for low-yield stocks

Same class of bug as the v5.5.0 expense-ratio fix. yfinance reports dividend yield
in two fields with units 100× apart — `dividendYield` is a percent, the trailing
field a fraction — while everything downstream expected a fraction, so a sub-1%
yield rendered 100× too high (Apple showed a 32% dividend yield). Yield is now
normalized once, preferring the unambiguous rate-over-price, so Apple reads 0.32%.

## Under the hood

The SEC EDGAR client gained a throttled company-facts fetch (XBRL financials) and a
document fetch (Form 4), both behind the same contact-address and 10-requests-a-second
rules as the filings timeline. Every new outside call is still keyless and public;
`FOLIO_SEC_CONTACT` continues to let you speak for yourself. No schema migration is
required, and installing over v5.5.0 preserves the existing database, holdings, trades,
DCA history, settings, and API key.

# FolioOrb v5.5.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 17, 2026

## Headline

FolioOrb now reads the primary sources directly: what your companies filed with
the SEC, what the Treasury says the yield curve is doing, and what your funds
actually charge you. All of it public, keyless, and free — no account, no key,
no middleman.

## What's New

### 🗂️ Straight from the filings

The News tab now shows what your companies told the SEC — material events (8-K),
quarterly and annual reports (10-Q, 10-K), and proxy statements — pulled straight
from EDGAR and linked to the source document. A filing from the last few days
also shows up as a possible catalyst in that holding's move explanation.

Only operating companies file with the SEC. Funds, crypto, and most foreign
listings have no filing record at all, so they are named as non-filers rather
than displayed as companies that happened to file nothing. No Claude key is
needed; filings work the same on Local Intelligence.

### 📐 The curve, and where fear actually sits

The market backdrop now reads the US Treasury par yield curve — the 2s10s and
3m10y spreads, published every business day — and reports where the VIX sits in
its own five-year range, which says more than the number alone.

An inverted curve is the bond market pricing cuts ahead, and it is one of the few
signals allowed to shift verdict weights toward quality and away from momentum. A
flat, normal, or steep curve is reported and left at that. If the curve cannot be
reached, it says so and the rest of the backdrop carries on.

### 💸 What your funds cost you

A new Exposure card turns each fund's expense ratio into the number that matters:
dollars per year at your position size, and what that compounds to over a decade —
including the growth those fees never got to earn. The long-horizon figure is a
projection under a stated growth assumption, and the assumption is printed next to
it. A fund whose fee cannot be read is listed as fee-unknown, never charged $0.

### 🧬 Whether your ETFs are the same bet

Holding three funds is not diversification if they hold the same companies. A new
card compares each pair of your ETFs across their top 10 published holdings and
shows what they share. It says exactly what it measured: top-10 overlap is a floor,
not the whole book.

### 🎯 Earnings with the bar attached

The earnings radar now carries the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report
and how often the company beat that estimate over the last four quarters — so
"reports in 3 days" arrives with the bar it is expected to clear. When there is no
estimate, the date still shows and FolioOrb does not guess.

## Fixed

### 🛡️ Fund fees were reading 100× too high

Yahoo reports expense ratios in two units that are exactly 100× apart, and
FolioOrb used whichever arrived first. The result: an ETF's fee could be scored in
the most expensive tier when it was in fact among the cheapest — a 0.03% index fund
read as "High" cost, quietly dragging its quality score and its verdict. Expense
ratios are now normalized once, at the source, so the fee view, the ETF quality
score, and the dashboard all agree.

## Under the hood

Each outside source now sits behind exactly one module — Yahoo, SEC EDGAR, and the
Treasury curve — so a provider can be swapped, throttled, or degraded in one place
instead of at every call site. The EDGAR client owns the SEC's two hard rules: a
declared contact address and a ceiling of ten requests a second. Filings are fetched
only for a single holding on demand, never for every holding on a dashboard load.

FolioOrb now sends a contact address to the SEC because the SEC requires one. Set
`FOLIO_SEC_CONTACT` in your `.env` to speak for yourself; it goes to the SEC and
nowhere else, and creates no account. No schema migration is required, and
installing over v5.4.2 preserves the existing SQLite database, holdings, trades,
DCA history, settings, and API key.

# FolioOrb v5.4.2 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 16, 2026

## Headline

Portfolio math, recurring-investment history, and AI narration now agree on one
honest view of your holdings — even when a quote is missing or a position has
already been sold.

## What's New

### 📐 Total return now counts every invested dollar

Portfolio total-return percentage now uses both the cost basis still invested
and the cost basis of shares already sold. Realized and unrealized gains were
already combined; their denominator now matches, so partially sold positions no
longer make the percentage look larger than it really is.

### 🛡️ Missing prices stay missing

Zero, non-finite, and malformed quotes are treated as unavailable instead of a
real $0 price. An incomplete valuation cannot write a daily performance snapshot
or ask Claude to narrate a portfolio briefing, analytics read, or action plan as
though every position were priced. FolioOrb identifies the missing tickers and
waits for complete market data.

### 🔁 DCA history remains reversible

A DCA plan with applied buys can no longer be deleted while its holding changes
remain in place. Undo those buys first, then delete the plan, preserving the
audit trail and keeping the ledger aligned with the holding.

### ✨ A sharper public home

The landing page and documentation now share a more deliberate type system and
visual rhythm. The architecture page also documents the financial integrity
modules that keep lifecycle, valuation, DCA, and narrative-cache rules coherent.

## Under the hood

Portfolio lifecycle, valuation, DCA persistence, and AI narrative caching now
sit behind four focused service interfaces instead of being duplicated across
routers. Portfolio deletion includes verdict history and scoped narratives;
ticker and portfolio narratives share the same freshness and serialization
rules. No schema migration is required, and installing over v5.4.1 preserves the
existing SQLite database, holdings, trades, DCA history, settings, and API key.

---

# FolioOrb v5.4.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

The last thing that wasn't per-portfolio now is: your verdict track record. The
Signals "how did my past calls age?" report card and the calibration stats are
scoped to the portfolio you're viewing, instead of mixing calls across all of
them.

## What's New

### 🎯 Verdict history is per-portfolio

Each portfolio now keeps its own record of the Add / Trim / Hold calls made for
it. Open the Signals tab in your IRA and you'll see how *its* calls aged — not a
blend of every portfolio's. New verdicts are tagged with the portfolio they were
logged for; verdicts recorded before this update are kept and attributed to your
default portfolio.

## Under the hood

Adds the additive `verdict_snapshots.portfolio_id` column (schema v4, backup-first
migration, existing rows backfilled to portfolio 1) and threads `portfolio_id`
through the verdict log, calibration buckets, and the `verdict-report` /
`verdict-calibration` endpoints. Installing over any 5.4.0 keeps everything in
place; new test proves no cross-portfolio verdict bleed.

---

# FolioOrb v5.4.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

Multiple portfolios. Give your taxable account, your IRA, and your fun-money
experiments their own separate scoreboards — each with its own holdings, P&L,
analytics, DCA plans, and AI narratives.

## What's New

### 🗂️ More than one portfolio

A portfolio switcher now lives in the top bar. Create as many portfolios as you
like, rename them, delete the ones you're done with, and switch between them in a
click — the whole dashboard (value, P&L, holdings, every analytics chart, news,
DCA plans, and the AI briefings/action-plans) re-scopes to the one you're
viewing. The Manage panel names the portfolio you're editing so there's never any
doubt which book a change lands in.

Everything stays cleanly separated: each portfolio's data is its own, and — the
part that's easy to get wrong — the AI's cached briefings and action plans are
namespaced per portfolio, so switching never shows you another portfolio's
narrative. Your first portfolio ("My Portfolio") is always there and can't be
deleted; new ones start empty with a friendly "add your first holding" prompt.

## Under the hood

The frontend scopes every portfolio API call through a single chokepoint (so no
panel can leak the wrong portfolio's data), the AI router and analytics snapshot
take a `portfolio_id` throughout, and the portfolio-level AI cache is keyed
`BOOK:<id>`. New create/rename/delete endpoints delete every child row
explicitly (holdings, trades, snapshots, DCA plans + contributions, and the
portfolio's AI cache). Installing over any 5.3.x keeps your existing holdings as
the default portfolio. New tests for portfolio management and AI scoping; still
no brokerage connection and still not financial advice.

# FolioOrb v5.3.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

Two of the gaps flagged in v5.3.0, closed: realized sales can now record the
*actual* price and date you sold at, and external links finally work in the
desktop app.

## What's New

### 💵 Record a sale at the real price and date

When you reduce a holding, the "record a sale" step now lets you enter the
**actual sale price** and **sale date** — pre-filled with today's market price
and today's date, but yours to change. Sold NVDA last month at $120? Enter it,
and the realized P&L and the year-end recap book it correctly, in the right tax
year — instead of always assuming today's price and today's date. Leave the
price blank to use the live market price, exactly as before.

### 🖥️ External links work in the desktop app

In the desktop window, links like **console.anthropic.com** (to grab a Claude
key) or the docs used to open a dead, chrome-less frame — or nothing. They now
open in your real browser. (In the web app they always worked; unchanged there.)

## Under the hood

`_record_reduction` takes an optional sale price/date; a new native `open_url`
bridge routes external links to the system browser. Static-asset cache-busters
were bumped so the fixes actually reach you on update. New tests for the sale
price/date path. Installing over any 5.3.0 keeps everything in place.

---

# FolioOrb v5.3.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

A resilience-and-honesty pass across the whole app: when the internet drops or a
key is wrong, FolioOrb now tells you the truth instead of quietly showing $0,
corrupting your history, or dead-ending — and a few sharp edges got filed down.

## What's New

### 🛡️ Never a scary $0 on a bad connection

If market data can't be reached, the dashboard used to show **$0.00 with a green
"synced" checkmark** — and, worse, it wrote that $0 into your performance history,
leaving a permanent fake cliff in the P&L and drawdown charts. Now an unreachable
data provider is detected: the app keeps your **last-known values**, shows an
honest "market data unavailable" status, and **does not** persist a bogus $0 day.

### 🔑 Honest about your Claude key

Saving an API key now actually checks it can reach Anthropic before saying
"connected." A revoked or mistyped (but well-formed) key is saved with a clear
"couldn't reach Anthropic — double-check it" message instead of a false all-clear.
You can also **disconnect Claude** right from the key panel now, dropping back to
Local Intelligence without hunting down a file. And the offline setup steps point
you at the one-click key panel — no more "edit .env and restart in a terminal,"
which a desktop user can't do anyway.

### ✋ No more accidental "sales" from a typo

Correcting a holding's share count (e.g. fixing a fat-fingered 100 → 10) used to
silently book a "sale" of the difference into your realized P&L. Now reducing
shares asks first — "records a sale of N at today's price; correcting a typo?
Cancel" — and mid-typing keystrokes no longer book phantom sales.

### ✨ Smaller sharp edges, filed down

- A brand-new (or emptied) portfolio shows a friendly **"Add your first holding"**
  prompt instead of a blank table.
- Removing a holding, a stuck world-markets strip, and a failed news load now
  fail **loudly and clearly** instead of silently.
- Best/worst/largest tiles clear when the portfolio empties (no stale winner next
  to a $0 total).
- Browser/OS shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+R, etc.) no longer double-fire app shortcuts, and
  Escape now dismisses the welcome guide.

## Under the hood

The valuation endpoint reports a `degraded` flag (detected without an extra quote
fetch) and skips the snapshot write when quotes are down; the key-config endpoint
verifies reachability and gained a `DELETE` to disconnect. New tests cover the
degraded path and the key flow. Installing over any 5.2.x keeps everything in
place; still no brokerage connection and still not financial advice.

---

# FolioOrb v5.2.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

A same-day polish pass on the new DCA plans: the bulk actions are now safe by
default, "undo" cleans up after itself, and pausing a plan finally does exactly
what it says.

## What's New

### 🛡️ Bulk actions that ask first — and undo in bulk

"Apply all" and "Skip all" now confirm before they touch anything, showing the
count and dollar total ("Apply all 12 VOO buys — $600 into your holding?"). And
applying a whole backfill is now reversible in one move: each plan gets an
**Undo applied** action that rolls every applied buy back at once.

### ⏸️ Pause means pause

Pausing a plan and resuming it later no longer retroactively books the buys you
skipped while it was paused. Resuming picks up from the day you resume — the
paused stretch stays skipped, as you'd expect.

### ✨ Smaller sharp edges, filed down

- Undoing a buy that empties a holding now retires that holding instead of
  leaving a $0 placeholder behind.
- Creating an exact-duplicate plan (same ticker, cadence, and amount) is blocked
  with a clear message, so you can't accidentally double-book — different amounts
  or cadences are still fine.
- Two plans on the same ticker are now told apart in the review bucket
  ("VOO · $50 weekly").
- A large backfill renders lightly (with a "…and N more — use Apply all" note),
  and a double-tap can no longer fire a duplicate action.

## Under the hood

Adds the additive `dca_plans.catchup_floor` column (schema v3, backup-first
migration) plus a bulk-undo endpoint. Installing over any 5.2.0 keeps every
plan, holding, and setting in place. Seven new tests; still no brokerage
connection and still not financial advice.

---

# FolioOrb v5.2.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

v5.2.0 answers the most-asked question — *"can it sync my Robinhood/Fidelity
auto-invest?"* — the local-first way: it doesn't connect to your broker, it
**mirrors** the recurring buy on your own machine, and never touches your
holdings until you say so.

## What's New

### 🔁 DCA auto-invest plans, simulated locally

Set a plan once — a ticker, a dollar amount, and a cadence (daily, weekly, or
monthly) — and FolioOrb does what your broker's auto-invest does, but on-device.
Each interval it books a buy priced at that day's **real closing price**
(weekends and holidays snap to the next trading day, just like a real fill) into
a *pending review bucket*. Nothing changes in your portfolio until you review it.

For every booked buy you choose: **Apply** it (your holding's shares and average
cost update), **Skip** it, or leave it for later. Every Apply is fully
reversible with **Undo**, and a skipped buy can be **Restored**. Set a start date
in the past and it backfills the whole history from real closes — with a
double-count guard if you already hold that ticker.

Because the app isn't always running, it *catches up* on open: reopen after a
week away and it fills in every buy you missed, idempotently — never
double-booking an interval. A badge on the DCA button tells you how many buys
are waiting.

## Under the hood

New local endpoints under `/api/dca` (plan CRUD, catch-up, apply/skip/undo/
restore, bulk apply/skip) backed by two new tables (`dca_plans`,
`dca_contributions`) added additively as schema v2 — the backup-first migration
path means installing over any 5.1.x keeps every holding, setting, and `.env` in
place. The date/price/cost engine is a pure, fully-tested module; historical
closes come from the same yfinance layer the rest of the app uses. 40 new tests;
still no brokerage connection and still not financial advice.

---

# FolioOrb v5.1.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 11, 2026

## Headline

v5.1.0 adds two honest ways to look *backward*: a year-by-year recap of the gains
you actually locked in, and a report card that grades FolioOrb's own past calls
by how they've since aged.

## What's New

### 🧮 Year-end realized recap

The Realized gains tab (Analytics → Performance) now opens with a recap of your
closed trades, bucketed by calendar year. Pick a year and see the realized P&L and
return, how many sales and tickers it covered, your winners-vs-losers count, and
the single best and worst position of the year. It reads *every* stored trade —
not just the last hundred — straight from your local database, no live quotes
needed. Tax season, with slightly less dread.

### 🧾 A verdict report card

The Signals tab (Analytics) gets an honest look in the mirror: FolioOrb grades its
own past Add / Trim / Hold calls by how the holding has actually done *since* the
call. An Add that rose counts; a Trim that fell counts; a Hold that stayed within
±10% counts. You get an overall "aged well" rate, a per-action breakdown, and a
ledger of recent calls with their return-since and a ✓ or ✗. Calls need a few days
to mature before they're graded, and it's a look-back, not a forward bet — small
samples are noisy, and none of it is financial advice.

## Under the hood

Both features are new local endpoints (`/api/portfolio/realized-summary`,
`/api/ai/verdict-report`) with dedicated tests. The verdict card prices its tickers
through the shared cached-quote layer with a hard latency cap, so it can never stall
a refresh. Nothing about your data or configuration changes — installing over any
5.0.x keeps everything in place.

# FolioOrb v5.0.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 9, 2026

## ✦ FolioOrb

> *Local-first portfolio intelligence in a native desktop app, with calmer
> updates, clearer docs, and a cleaner home for the project.*

The product, the app window, the installers, the docs, and the repository are
now **FolioOrb**. The project lives at
[github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb) and the
website at [udhawan97.github.io/FolioOrb](https://udhawan97.github.io/FolioOrb/).
The in-app engine voice ("FolioOrb Intelligence") is now "FolioOrb
Intelligence".

**Data stays local.** FolioOrb stores its database, settings, update history,
and logs in the normal per-user data directory for your platform.

**Download assets and docs now use the FolioOrb name** —
`FolioOrb-macOS-arm64-v5.0.0.dmg` and `FolioOrb-Windows-x64-v5.0.0-Setup.exe`.

FolioOrb remains local-first, Claude-optional, never places trades, and reports
to nobody.

## Upgrade Notes

- **In-app update (macOS):** because the macOS app bundle is renamed
  (`FolioOrb.app` → `FolioOrb.app`), an existing install may report the
  in-app swap as "couldn't install" for this one release and leave your old app
  in place — your data is never at risk. If that happens, download
  `FolioOrb-macOS-arm64-v5.0.0.dmg` once from the releases page; your portfolio
  migrates automatically on first launch. Future updates swap seamlessly again.
- **In-app update (Windows):** upgrades in place; the installer keeps the same
  application id so your existing install is recognized.
- **From source:** `git pull` continues to work; your local `.env` and
  `database/` are untouched.

---

# FolioOrb v4.5.2 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 9, 2026

## Headline

v4.5.2 is a **reliability patch** — no new features, just a full-codebase bug
audit and the fixes it surfaced. The theme: your numbers stay honest and your
data stays safe, even when the market data feeding them doesn't.

## Fixes

### Analytics & verdicts — no more silently-wrong numbers

- **A bad price no longer poisons your risk math.** A zero or negative close from
  the data feed (a halted or delisted ticker, a data glitch) used to turn a
  logarithmic return into `-inf`/`NaN` and quietly contaminate annualized return,
  volatility, and correlation for the whole portfolio. Those bad days are now
  treated as flat, in both the risk analytics and the growth projection.
- **Correlation tells the truth when it can't compute.** A frozen or zero-variance
  price series makes correlation mathematically undefined; the matrix used to
  paper over that with a fake `0.0`. It now reports "no data" honestly instead.
- **Trim verdicts score the right way round.** The valuation confidence for a
  *trim* was using the *add* scale, so a cheap ("Bargain") stock could be handed
  a high-confidence trim. Trim now scores the mirror image — low confidence to
  trim something cheap, high to trim something rich.
- **Action Plan cache no longer confuses two different books.** Two portfolios
  with the same dominant verdict but a different secondary lean (e.g. "mostly
  hold, then add" vs "mostly hold, then trim") could share one cached plan. The
  cache key now accounts for the secondary action.

### Your data & the updater

- **A failed restore can never leave you with no database.** Rolling back now
  copies the backup to a staging file and re-verifies it *before* moving your
  live database aside — so an interrupted or out-of-space restore leaves your
  current data exactly where it was instead of half-swapped.
- **Honest rollback messaging.** If your data restores but the saved settings
  (`.env`) don't, you're told exactly that, instead of a misleading "nothing
  happened."
- **Watchlist edits never fabricate P&L.** Reducing shares on a research-mode
  (watchlist) holding no longer records a phantom realized trade — matching how
  deleting one already behaved.
- Unverified partial downloads are cleaned up on error, and a long-running
  desktop session no longer accumulates dead price-cache entries.

### Hardening

- The batch price-history endpoint validates its `period` like the single-ticker
  one does; an out-of-range value is rejected cleanly instead of quietly
  returning nothing.
- The in-app release-notes link is scheme-checked before it's used, and a
  rejected ticker is sanitized before it reaches the logs.

## Upgrade Notes

No database migration or `.env` change required. Update in-app from **Settings →
Software Update**, or download the installer from the releases page.

# FolioOrb v4.5.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 9, 2026

## Headline

v4.5.1 is a **polish patch** on the spreadsheet release: CSV export and the
import template now hand you a real file in the desktop app, instead of opening
as a wall of text with no way back.

## What's Fixed

### 📥 Export & template actually download in the desktop app

The packaged app is a native window, not a browser tab — and it has no download
chrome. So clicking **Export CSV** or **Download template** used to *navigate* to
the file and render it inline as raw text: no Save dialog, no download, no back
button. Both now route through a native **Save As…** dialog and write an actual
`.csv` (UTF-8 with the byte-order mark Excel likes). In a regular browser,
downloads work exactly as they always did. Either way you get a file, not a dead end.

## Also in this release

- **Website polish** — Senpai now gets his own animated spotlight above the
  footer, a refreshed one-liner pill, and CSV import is called out directly in
  the workflow walkthrough.

Nothing about your data, holdings, or configuration changes in this update.
Installing over v4.5.0 or earlier keeps everything in place.

---

# FolioOrb v4.5.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 9, 2026

## Headline

v4.5.0 is the **spreadsheet release**: your holdings move in and out as CSV, so
setting up FolioOrb no longer means retyping thirty tickers by hand — and
neither does backing them up.

## What's New

### 📤 Export your holdings as CSV

One click in the portfolio manager downloads your active holdings as a clean,
tidy CSV — positions and watchlist alike. It's UTF-8 with the columns Excel
expects, and every cell is escaped against spreadsheet formula injection. The
file you get *is* the import template, so it round-trips straight back in.

### 📥 Import holdings — two ways, one set of rules

- **Local (always available, no API key):** a strict, exact-schema parse of the
  template. Deterministic, free, offline. This is the default and it is never
  gated.
- **Claude assist (when a key is configured):** drop in almost any brokerage
  export — `Symbol`/`Qty`/`Cost`-style columns and currency symbols and all —
  and Claude maps the columns onto the FolioOrb format for you. Every mapped
  row still passes the *same* strict validation before it touches your book, and
  clean template files skip Claude entirely (zero tokens). If Claude is slow or
  unavailable, the import quietly falls back to the strict local parse and tells
  you it did — it never fails just because Claude did.

Either way you get a per-row report — added, skipped (duplicates are skipped,
never overwritten), or errored with a plain-English reason — plus, in Claude
mode, a short Senpai-narrated recap. The portfolio manager shows which mode
you're in and updates live when you connect or disconnect a key.

### Safety, as usual

Formula-injection escaping on export, a 256 KB / 200-row import cap, content-type
and encoding checks (UTF-8 BOM and Windows `cp1252` both welcome), ticker
shape-validation before any network call, duplicate-column and non-finite-number
rejection, and Claude only ever sees a small, capped sample of the file — never
the whole thing.

## Upgrade Notes

No database migration or `.env` change required. Existing holdings are untouched;
importing a file you exported earlier is a safe no-op (every row dup-skips).

# FolioOrb v4.4.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 9, 2026

---

## ✦ Fixed: the updater showing "You're offline" while online

The `v4.4.1` desktop app shipped with a bug in the very feature this release
introduces: the packaged macOS and Windows apps reported **"You're offline"**
when checking for updates, even on a fully connected machine. Root cause: the
frozen app's bundled OpenSSL pointed at a build-machine certificate path that
doesn't exist on a user's computer, so every HTTPS request to GitHub failed
certificate verification — and that failure was generically caught as
"offline" instead of being told apart from a real network outage.

This is fixed in the `v4.4.1` assets as published (the release was re-built and
re-published with the fix before wide distribution — if you downloaded before
today, grab it again from the same link, the version number is unchanged):

- **The real fix**: the update checker now verifies HTTPS against certifi's CA
  bundle, which ships inside the app. This is the actual root cause fix, not a
  copy change.
- **Failures are told apart, not lumped together**: "You're offline" is now
  reserved for a genuine network outage. A certificate problem says *"Couldn't
  securely check for updates,"* a GitHub rate limit says *"GitHub rate limit
  reached,"* and a malformed response or server hiccup gets its own message —
  each is also logged with a sanitized diagnostic reason for support.
- **A real in-app update on macOS.** Clicking **Update Now** no longer just
  opens the DMG for you to drag manually — the app downloads it, verifies its
  checksum (and signature, once minisign is enabled), backs up your data,
  quits, swaps in the new version, and relaunches itself automatically.
  Windows keeps its existing one-click silent install. Your portfolio database
  and `.env` live outside the app bundle entirely, so nothing in this flow can
  touch them, and a failed swap safely falls back to your current version with
  a clear "your data is safe" message.

## ✦ Software Update, done right

> *v4.4.1 adds a professional, consent-first update system. FolioOrb can now tell you when a new version is out, download and install it with your permission, and — most importantly — protect your holdings across every update, with a real way back if anything goes wrong.*

**Nothing updates without your say-so.** The app checks quietly for new versions (about 30 seconds after launch, then daily — you can turn this off) and, when one is available, shows a single calm indicator. Opening it reveals a Software Update sheet modelled on the macOS one: what's new, the download size, whether a relaunch is needed, and clear **Update Now / Later** actions. You can also check any time from the **Check for Updates…** menu item or **Settings → Software Update**.

**Your holdings are protected at every step.** Before an update installs, FolioOrb takes a verified backup of your portfolio database and your settings — and if that backup can't be made, the update is paused rather than risking your data. Backup verification checks the database's actual holdings count, not just that a file exists, so a backup that silently lost data is caught before it's ever trusted. Database migrations get the same protection: a version bump backs up first and, if a migration ever failed, automatically restores the last good state. After updating, a quiet confirmation notes that your holdings came through intact.

**A real way back.** If an update misbehaves, **Restore previous version…** (in Settings, and offered automatically after repeated failed launches) rolls back to the prior version. It always snapshots your current data first, so nothing is lost either way; you choose whether to also restore the pre-update data. Rolling back refuses to run while another update is already in progress, so the two can't collide.

**Trustworthy downloads.** Every update package is verified by SHA-256 against the checksums published with the release before it's installed; corrupted or interrupted downloads are rejected or resumed. Optional minisign signing (see `packaging/SIGNING.md`) adds cryptographic authenticity when enabled. Release notes are rendered as text, not raw HTML — a malicious link in a release body can't inject a script into the app.

**Verification:** the update system was built in eight phases, then put through two rounds of adversarial review and a dedicated pass on the frozen-app connectivity fix above — multi-angle code review plus live testing of every state (checking, available, downloading, verifying, backing up, ready, installing, offline, error, rollback) against the actual installed `.app`, not just source. Together these caught and fixed the TLS/offline root cause plus nine other real issues before wide distribution, including a data-loss gap in backup verification, an XSS path in release-notes rendering, two settings/rollback race conditions, and a macOS "quit unexpectedly" crash on every app exit. 256 dedicated offline tests cover backup/restore, migration safety, download/verify, rollback, signature checking, TLS/error classification, and the macOS bundle-swap install; `pylint` holds at 10.00 across every module.

No action is required on update: your holdings, settings, and `.env` are preserved.

## ✦ Quieter Hot Paths

> *v4.3.4 is a performance and hygiene release. No feature changes, no data migration — a handful of targeted fixes to the code that runs most often, so the dashboard stays smooth as portfolios and interactions scale up.*

The v4.3.1–v4.3.3 releases went after scrolling and range-switching. This one tightens the small, high-frequency paths that add up: number formatting that runs on every rendered value, and the correlation heatmap's hover behavior.

**Currency formatting no longer allocates per value.** Every dollar figure on the dashboard — holdings rows, tables, tiles, movers — was built with a freshly constructed `Intl.NumberFormat` on each call. Constructing that object is far more expensive than the formatting itself. The currency formatter (and the two world-market price formatters) are now built once and reused, so rendering a portfolio with many positions does proportionally less work. Output is byte-for-byte identical.

**The correlation heatmap stops rebuilding its canvas on hover.** Moving the mouse across the heatmap re-ran the full draw routine, which reassigned the canvas's pixel dimensions every time — and setting a canvas's width or height reallocates and clears its entire backing store, even when the size hasn't changed. The redraw now only touches the bitmap dimensions when they actually change; the per-frame clear is unchanged, so the picture is identical.

**Hover and resize work is coalesced to one pass per frame.** The heatmap's `mousemove` handler ran a layout read plus a possible redraw on every raw event; it's now throttled to `requestAnimationFrame`, doing at most one pass per frame with the freshest pointer position. The two dashboard-zone indicator handlers, which read and then write layout on every resize event, are throttled the same way.

**Also fixed two rough edges found during release verification:**

- **Misleading "AI failed" warnings when no Claude API key is configured.** Running key-free (the default "Local Intelligence" mode) made the Anthropic SDK raise a client-side `TypeError` on every portfolio briefing, analytics insight, and action plan request — an expected, harmless condition, but it was logged as `AI briefing failed`, `AI analytics insights failed`, etc. at warning level on every dashboard load, indistinguishable from a real failure. These three call sites now log at debug with an accurate "no Claude API key configured" message when no key is set, and still warn normally on a genuine failure with a key present. No change to what's returned to the dashboard — the deterministic local fallback was already correct.
- **The greyed-out "Local Intel" engine toggle opened the wrong panel.** With no API key configured, the Engine toggle in the menu correctly shows as disabled (dimmed, "not-allowed" cursor, a tooltip explaining why) — but tapping it opened the passive "Meet FolioOrb" intro card, which only tells you to hand-edit `.env` and restart the server. It now opens the actual **Connect Claude AI** panel directly — paste a key and hit **Save & Connect**, no restart needed — and closes the menu first so the panel isn't covered by it. Once a key is saved, the same control becomes a live toggle between Local and Claude AI, exactly as before.

**Verification:** the full 381-test suite passes, `pylint` holds at 10.00/10, the app boots and renders cleanly, and the currency/market formatters were confirmed to produce identical output after the change. The engine-toggle fix was verified end-to-end in a running build (disabled state → tap → key panel opens, unobstructed). The theme, spacing, typography, and animations are untouched — these changes are internal to how existing work is scheduled and routed, not what is drawn.

No holdings, settings, or `.env` changes are required — installing v4.3.4 over v4.3.3 or earlier keeps everything as-is.

# FolioOrb v4.3.3 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 8, 2026

---

## ✦ One Range, Every Section

> *v4.3.3 adds a 1W time range and makes range switching mean something everywhere on the dashboard — not just the P&L card.*

Until now, the Today / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y switcher on the Overview tab only drove the hero P&L number. Everything below it — the sector/movers panel, the portfolio briefing, the allocation focus read — stayed locked to "today," even after you'd switched to a longer view. v4.3.3 makes the whole dashboard follow your selection.

**Added a 1W option.** The switcher is now Today, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, same chip style, same keyboard/hover/focus behavior.

**The range now drives four sections, not one.** Switch to 1M and "Today's impact" becomes "Past month impact" with real per-holding movers for that window, the portfolio briefing narrates the month instead of the day, and the allocation focus panel's "why it moved" read updates to match. All four read from one shared selected range instead of managing it independently.

**Fixed a real inconsistency this surfaced during testing.** The hero P&L card computed longer ranges from the app's own daily snapshot history, which needs weeks of actual usage to build up — so a newer portfolio would show "1M P&L: --" directly above a movers panel already showing a real number for that same month, pulled from actual market price history instead. The hero card now falls back to the same price-history calculation when snapshot history is too short, so the two numbers agree instead of one going blank.

**Performance:** all five non-day ranges are served by a single new endpoint in one request (not five), cached client-side per holdings set so re-selecting a previously-viewed range is instant with zero network calls. Rapid range switching cancels stale renders instead of flashing old data, each section fails independently with its own inline error/retry instead of taking down the dashboard, and the manual refresh button now refreshes range data too instead of only quotes.

No holdings, settings, or `.env` changes are required — installing v4.3.3 over v4.3.2 or earlier keeps everything as-is.

# FolioOrb v4.3.2 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 8, 2026

---

## ✦ Scrolling, Finished

> *v4.3.2 is the second half of the v4.3.1 scroll-performance fix. Same goal — no feature changes, no data migration — this time aimed at portfolios with a real number of holdings in them.*

v4.3.1 fixed the background and blur effects that made every scroll frame expensive everywhere in the app. That was a real win, but it left the biggest cost in place for anyone with more than a handful of positions: the Holdings table itself, and a quieter bug in how its sparklines redraw.

**Fixed the sparkline redraw.** Each row's 7-day trend chart lives in a canvas that redraws whenever it scrolls into view. The check for "did this row's data actually change" was being skipped, so every row repainted on every pass through the viewport — even rows that hadn't moved. A holding's canvas now only repaints when its underlying price history actually changes, verified pixel-for-pixel: unchanged data draws nothing, changed data draws correctly.

**Fixed the real cost: tables you can't see still cost you.** Switching away from the Holdings tab hid it with `visibility: hidden`, which keeps a hidden element fully "in play" for the browser's layout engine. With enough holdings, the Holdings table's column-width math is expensive — and it was being recomputed on every scroll frame on *every* tab, Overview and News included, because the hidden Holdings table was still there to think about. It's now skipped entirely while off-screen and restored instantly when you switch back, so the other tabs stop paying rent for a table they're not showing.

**Measured result (30-holding portfolio, the case that showed it worst):** Overview scrolling roughly **4× faster**, Analytics and News both meaningfully smoother, Holdings itself close to **4× faster**. Two CSS approaches that looked promising on paper — a stricter table layout mode, and a narrower containment hint — were tested, measured, and dropped: one visibly shifted column widths on smaller windows, the other simply didn't help. Neither shipped.

No holdings, settings, or `.env` changes are required — installing v4.3.2 over v4.3.1 or earlier keeps everything as-is.

# FolioOrb v4.3.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 8, 2026

---

## ✦ Smooth Scrolling in the Desktop App

> *v4.3.1 is a performance release. The desktop app scrolled sluggishly on macOS; this fixes it — no feature changes, no data migration, just a much smoother dashboard.*

The native app (macOS DMG / Windows EXE) renders inside a system WebView — WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows — which pays a much steeper per-frame cost for certain effects than a desktop browser does. On slower machines that showed up as laggy, sluggish scrolling. v4.3.1 removes those hot spots:

**Fixed the two universal scroll killers.** The ambient page background used `background-attachment: fixed`, which forces the browser to repaint the entire glow gradient on *every* scroll frame; it now lives on a fixed, compositor-cached layer that's painted once. The drifting background "orbs" carried a heavy `blur(40px)` filter that had to be re-rasterized each frame while they animated; the blur is gone (the glows were already soft radial gradients) and the drift is now a cheap, GPU-composited transform. Both changes benefit the browser and from-source runs too.

**Added a desktop-app rendering profile.** Inside the native WebView, the app now switches to a lighter profile that drops `backdrop-filter` (frosted surfaces fall back to near-opaque fills, so the look holds up) and freezes a few always-on ambient animations. The in-browser and run-from-source experience is deliberately left at full fidelity — nothing was removed from the design.

**Measured result:** roughly a **3× improvement** in scroll frame rate on the overview and analytics views under CPU-throttled testing, with janky frames cut by about two-thirds. No holdings, settings, or `.env` changes are required — installing v4.3.1 over v4.3.0 keeps everything as-is.

# FolioOrb v4.3 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 7, 2026

---

## ✦ FolioOrb Goes Desktop

> *v4.3 is the release where FolioOrb stops being a thing you set up and starts being a thing you download. No Python, no terminal, no `pip install` — just a native app.*

Until now, running FolioOrb meant having Python on your machine and a comfortable relationship with a terminal. v4.3 removes that entirely. There are now real installers — a **`.dmg`** for macOS (Apple Silicon) and a clean per-user **`.exe`** for Windows — that drop a native app on your machine and open the dashboard in its own window. The FastAPI server still runs locally; it just runs *inside* the app now instead of a terminal tab you have to keep alive.

**One-click installers.** Download the [macOS DMG](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/releases/latest) or [Windows installer](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/releases/latest), launch it, and you're in. Your database and `.env` live in the per-user data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/FolioOrb` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\FolioOrb` on Windows) — never inside the app bundle — so updates and uninstalls leave your portfolio untouched.

**An automated, honest release pipeline.** Every version tag builds both platforms in GitHub Actions, smoke-tests that the frozen app actually boots, and only *then* publishes the installers plus a `SHA256SUMS.txt` to GitHub Releases. A broken build can never replace a good download. Every merge to `main` also refreshes a rolling `latest-main` prerelease for early testers, kept clearly separate from stable.

**A download-first website.** The [landing page](https://udhawan97.github.io/FolioOrb/) was rebuilt around real, retina screenshots of the actual dashboard — it detects your OS, links straight to the current installer, and shows the live release version, date, and commit. The docs gained a full Download & Install section with macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen walkthroughs.

**Signing, honestly.** These early builds are not yet code-signed, so macOS and Windows will show a first-launch warning. That's expected for an open-source app without a paid certificate, and the install guides show exactly what you'll see and how to verify your download against the published checksums. Code signing and notarization are the planned next step.

v4.3 is the release that turns a project you clone into a product you install.

# FolioOrb v4.2 Release Notes

**Release date:** July 7, 2026

---

## ✦ Meet Senpai, and Never Get Lost on Day One

> *v4.2 is the release where the orb finally got a name it can keep. Say hello to Senpai — and to the welcome guide that explains what everything means before you have to ask.*

The dashboard's resident orb has a name now, everywhere it lives. What used to be "dashboard pet" / "Portfolio Butler" scattered across the codebase — IDs, CSS classes, JS variables, the `localStorage` key, the visible label — is now **Senpai**, top to bottom. Same orb, same corner of the screen, same personality. Just one name instead of three.

Senpai also got something to actually say. Alongside its usual Claude-flirting commentary, it now rotates in genuine tips and tricks — what Research mode does, what each hold-type icon means, the `M` and `?` shortcuts — surfacing roughly one time in four so they read as a helpful aside, not a lecture.

Brand-new installs get a proper welcome now instead of an empty dashboard. On first launch with zero holdings, a one-time guide walks through adding a holding, what Research mode means, and what each of the four hold-type icons — Auto, Trade, Core, Anchor — actually does, sourced straight from the same tooltips the rest of the app already uses. Dismiss it once and it's gone for good.

The documentation site also got fixed. Five internal links were quietly 404ing on GitHub Pages because they didn't account for the site's base path — worth fixing since v4.2 also adds a **Documentation** link directly in the app's menu, so it needs to actually work.

v4.2 is a naming exercise and a first-impression fix, wrapped around one bug nobody had reported yet but everybody would have hit eventually.

---

## What's New

### Senpai (formerly "dashboard pet")

- Full rename across `templates/index.html`, `static/js/dashboard.js`, and `static/css/style.css` — every id, class, JS variable/function, CSS keyframe, and the `localStorage` key (now `folioorb-dashboard-senpai-visible`) says `senpai`, not `pet`.
- The one visible label, "Portfolio Butler," is now "Senpai."
- Pure naming pass — no behavior changed; `_HOLD_MODE_META` and every other tooltip are untouched.

### Tips & Tricks Quotes

- New `DASHBOARD_SENPAI_TIP_QUOTES` array — genuinely useful one-liners covering Research mode, the four hold-type modes, and the `M`/`?` shortcuts.
- Woven into the existing quote rotation in `showQuote()` at roughly a 1-in-4 chance per cycle (`SENPAI_TIP_QUOTE_CHANCE = 0.25`) without disturbing the underlying rotation index, so the regular commentary still cycles in order.

### First-Run Welcome Guide

- New modal (`#senpai-welcome-guide`), shown once when a fresh install has zero holdings, covering: adding a holding, what Research mode does, and the four hold-type icons — the hold-type list renders directly from `_HOLD_MODE_META` so it can never drift from the tooltips shown elsewhere in the app.
- Dismissal (close button or backdrop click) persists via `folioorb-senpai-welcome-seen` in `localStorage`; "Add your first holding" closes the guide and opens the portfolio manager directly.

### Documentation

- Fixed 5 internal docs-site links (`troubleshooting.md`, `get-started/introduction.md`, `get-started/claude-setup.md`) that rendered without the GitHub Pages base path and 404'd — converted to relative links, which resolve correctly regardless of base path.
- Added a **Documentation** entry to the nav overflow menu, linking to the hosted docs site in a new tab.

---

## Developer Notes

- FastAPI metadata version bumped to **`4.2.0`** (previous releases kept it pinned at `4.0.0`).
- Static cache keys: `style.css?v=101`, `dashboard.js?v=94`, `analytics-charts.js?v=14`.
- **366 tests passing** (up from 361 in v4.1) — 2 existing tests in `test_intelligence_engine_ui.py` were updated to assert on the new `senpai-*` identifiers instead of the old `pet-*` ones.
- No database schema changes — no migration required.
- No `.env` changes required.

---

## Install & Upgrade

**Prerequisite:** Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Windows: check "Add Python to PATH" during install.

### Mac — one command

### Windows — one command

Open PowerShell (Win+R → "powershell"), paste, and press Enter:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/release-v4.2/scripts/install-win.ps1 | iex
```

Downloads, installs, and places a **FolioOrb** shortcut on your Desktop. Browser opens automatically. Next time: double-click the Desktop shortcut.

### Upgrading from v4.1

Run the same install command above — it detects your existing `database/` and `.env`, preserves them, and starts the updated app. No manual backup or file copying required.

No schema migration or `.env` change required. If you had toggled Senpai's visibility off before this update, it resets to visible once (the `localStorage` key changed names) — toggle it back off from menu → Dashboard → Senpai if you'd rather it stay hidden.

---

## Final Word

v4.2 is still not financial advice. It's just the release where the orb got a name, first launches got a map, and the docs stopped sending people into the void.

---

# FolioOrb v4.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** June 28, 2026

---

## ✦ The Dashboard Finally Knows Its Own Key

> *v4.1 is the release where setup stopped requiring a text editor. You can now hand Claude your API key from the dashboard itself — and watch it spend every token in real time.*

FolioOrb now has an **in-dashboard API key panel**. Click the brand mark, paste your `sk-ant-*` key, and the dashboard validates it, writes it to `.env`, and reconnects Claude without a restart. No terminal. No `.env` file hunting. Input is validated client-side and server-side against the canonical Anthropic key format before a single character touches disk.

The cost HUD in the nav got honest. Instead of estimating from cache occupancy, the dashboard now tracks **real token counts** across every Claude call made in the session. The nav breakdown shows actual input and output tokens, a live cost figure, and a predicted per-run annotation derived from backend constants — so you always know what a full scan costs before you click refresh again.

The holdings table got faster and more responsive. Rows now expand on the **first click**, latency on the expand path was cut, and an **auto-refresh** keeps prices current without manual intervention. The Overview sector graph was refactored to render weighted bars with proper proportional fills and a clean overflow note.

v4.1 is a tightening: the same cockpit, now easier to configure and harder to misread.

---

## What's New

### In-Dashboard API Key Configuration

- **`POST /api/ai/configure-key`** — accepts an `api_key` body, validates against `^sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{20,300}$`, writes a single `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…` line to `.env` (creating the file if absent), and reloads the Anthropic client in-process. No restart required.
- **API Key panel** — accessible from the brand mark in the nav. Password-type input with show/hide toggle, live keystroke validation (strips paste garbage, checks format character-by-character), a save button that activates only when the key is structurally valid, and an inline status message on success or failure. Closes on click-outside and Escape.
- **Heartbeat reconnect** — on a successful key save the panel triggers a fresh `/api/ai/heartbeat` call so the HUD mode chip updates from Local → Claude AI without reloading the page.
- **`reinitialize_client()`** in `ai_service.py` — hot-swaps the module-level Anthropic client with a new key, allowing the server to pick up a key change without process restart.

### Live Token Cost Tracking

- **`_track_usage()`** in `ai_service.py` — called after every `client.messages.create()`, accumulates `total_in` / `total_out` across the process lifetime in a module-level counter.
- **`get_accumulated_usage()`** — exposes the live totals for the cache stats route.
- **`/api/ai/cache/stats`** now returns:
  - `actual_input_tokens` / `actual_output_tokens` / `actual_cost_usd` — real tracked tokens from this session
  - `predicted_per_run.cost_usd` — computed from `_PREDICTED_IN/OUT_PER_RUN` constants using live pricing, so updating the constants or rates reflects immediately on next poll
  - `pricing` block — input/output rates the frontend reads directly; rates are no longer hardcoded in JS
- **Cost HUD** — frontend prefers actual tracked tokens when available, falls back to cache estimate when none have been spent. Appends `~$0.0003 / full scan (~5,600 tok)` to the breakdown line derived from backend constants.

### Holdings Table

- **Auto-refresh** — the holdings table now refreshes live prices on an interval without a manual trigger. A subtle CSS indicator marks the refresh cycle.
- **First-click expand** — rows now inject the summary expansion via `injectSummaryRows` before attempting to open, so the detail pane appears on the very first click. The previous two-click flow is gone.
- **Latency patch** — the expand path was rescheduled to reduce perceived latency; the scanning animation fires immediately while intelligence loads asynchronously behind it.

### Overview Sector Graph

- **Proportional fills** — sector bars now render weighted fills using `--snapshot-fill` CSS custom properties, scaled relative to the top sector rather than absolute percentages, so a single-dominant-sector portfolio does not show every bar at 100%.
- **Overflow note** — when more sectors are held than the strip can display, a `+N more` note appears below the visible bars.
- **Dot + track layout** — each row now has a leading coloured dot, a labelled track, and a fill bar, replacing the previous plain-text list.

### Bug Fixes

- **Font resize regression** — a resize event was causing text scaling to clamp incorrectly when the panel container had not yet fully painted; the measurement is now deferred past the layout tick.
- **Scrolling bug** — a competing `overflow` rule on the holdings container was intercepting scroll events on the inner panel; specificity corrected.
- **Ticker management** — adding a ticker through the manage modal now correctly triggers a fresh quote load for the newly added position without requiring a full page reload.

---

## Developer Notes

- FastAPI metadata version still **`4.0.0`** — no API contract changes, only additions.
- New endpoint: `POST /api/ai/configure-key` — in `app/routers/ai.py`
- New helper: `_update_env_file(key, value)` — writes a single `KEY=VALUE` line to `.env` atomically; creates the file if absent
- New functions in `ai_service.py`: `_track_usage()`, `get_accumulated_usage()`, `reinitialize_client()`
- Static cache keys: `style.css?v=99`, `dashboard.js?v=91`, `analytics-charts.js?v=14`
- **361 tests passing** (up from 356 in v4.0)
- No database schema changes — no migration required.
- No `.env` changes required; the key panel writes `.env` for you.

# FolioOrb v4.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** June 27, 2026

---

## ✦ The Portfolio Finally Has Opinions

> *v4.0 is the release where the dashboard stopped watching your book and started reading it. Now it tells you what to do with it — and what the market is saying about it while you decide.*

Your portfolio now has an **Action Plan**. Claude reads the full book — signals, regime, concentration, earnings risk — and comes back with a prioritized Hold / Add / Trim / Exit breakdown, a thesis for each bucket, and the macro mood ring right there on the card. No Claude key? The local fallback runs the same bucket logic deterministically and generates plain-language headlines and per-bucket priority moves, no API call, no wait. Either way, the plan is cached for 24 hours and invalidates itself when your portfolio's dominant action or concentration meaningfully shifts — so rebalancing clears the stale take without you having to ask.

Your portfolio also has a **News tab** now — a fourth zone alongside Overview, Holdings, and Analytics. It pulls live yfinance headlines for every active holding, dedupes, caches, and groups them by ticker. In Claude mode it adds a portfolio-wide briefing and a set of cross-holding theme clusters so you can see which macro story is quietly working three of your positions at once. Holdings with no news still appear; the feed never silently drops a position.

The cockpit got a deeper pass too. The dark canvas is noticeably darker, panels lift off it cleanly, the gain/loss bar is taller, the P&L glow is more dramatic, the sector strip is glassier, and two cascading specificity bugs that were leaving icon pills cramped in the holdings table were finally rooted out and killed.

v4.0 is the release where "what does this mean?" gets a partner: "what should I actually do about it?"

---

## What's New

### Action Plan

- **`/api/ai/action-plan`** — Claude reads the full portfolio signal snapshot and returns a prioritized bucket plan: Hold / Add / Trim / Exit. Each bucket carries a thesis, top moves, and supporting context. Cached 24 h in `AISummary` (ticker=`BOOK`, type=`action_plan`). Falls back deterministically when Claude is unavailable or `force_local=True`.
- **Drift invalidation** — the cache key includes the portfolio's dominant-action distribution and concentration signature. Rebalancing or a meaningful shift in signals automatically invalidates the cached plan so a stale take never lingers after you act.
- **Regime-aware context** — the plan surfaces the current market regime (risk-on / risk-off / neutral) alongside the thesis so bucket decisions have macro backdrop, not just holding-level math.
- **Local fallback with real language** — when Claude is not in the loop, the fallback now builds a plain-language headline from the dominant signal ("3 positions flagged for trim/exit — 4 anchors steady") and generates per-bucket priority moves with specific tickers and actionable copy.
- **Action Plan UI** — four bucketed cards with colour-accented top borders, regime chip, Claude vs Local mode badge, per-bucket thesis, and a refresh button. Skeleton loading state holds layout during the fetch so the card does not pop.

### News

- **`/api/news/feed`** — always available (no Claude key needed). Fetches and caches yfinance headlines for all active holdings and watchlist tickers concurrently. Normalized, deduped, and sorted by recency. Holdings with no news are still included so the feed never silently omits a position.
- **`/api/news/themes`** — Claude mode only, gated on heartbeat. One Haiku call per unique headline signature: a second-person portfolio briefing ("here is what today's news means for your book") plus cross-holding theme clusters grouping the macro narrative that is hitting multiple positions at once.
- **`news_service.py`** — new service covering fetch, in-memory TTL caching (5 min during market hours, 1 h when closed), normalization, dedup, and concurrent multi-ticker fetching.

### UI Polish

- **Darker canvas** — `--bg-base` deepened (`#0a0a0f` → `#050508`), surface opacities pulled back, nav surface opacity raised (`0.62` → `0.88`). Every panel now has more room to lift off the background.
- **Snapshot panel shell** — panels carry their own opaque dark surface, a stronger top-edge inset highlight, and a real drop shadow.
- **Sector strip** — taller (4.5 rem → 6 rem), border-radius bumped, segment sheen dialed back (0.28 → 0.18) for a glassier feel.
- **Gain/loss bar** — taller (0.7 rem → 1 rem); mover tracks taller (0.48 rem → 0.65 rem) with a higher-contrast track background.
- **P&L glow** — text-shadow radius widened (22 px → 32 px) for a more dramatic green/red bleed on positive and negative days.
- **Briefing card** — ambient periwinkle crown stronger (9% → 14%), header padding bumped, separator upgraded from `--hairline` to `--hairline-hover`.
- **Holdings mode box icon fix** — a specificity collision between the GROUP rule (0,2,0) and the per-element rule (0,2,0) left `min-height` losing unpredictably, clipping icons at the top of manage-modal pill buttons. Parent-scoped selectors at (0,3,0) now definitively own `min-height`, `justify-content`, and `overflow` for both modal segments and table-row strips.

### Bug Fixes

- **Mode persistence** — `initDashboardPet()` was hardcoding `_forcedLocalMode = true` on every page load, silently overwriting the preference saved by `enableClaudeAiAndReload()`. The fix reads the `PET_MODE_KEY` value from `localStorage` and only defaults to local (`"1"`) when no preference is stored. Switching to Claude AI now sticks across reloads.
- Two new tests in `tests/test_intelligence_engine_ui.py`: one asserting the init function reads localStorage and `enableClaudeAiAndReload()` writes `"0"`, one asserting the nav Engine toggle and the banner "Enable Claude AI" button both exist with correct `aria-pressed` and JS wiring.

# FolioOrb v3.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** June 27, 2026

---

## ✦ Warm on Arrival

> *v3.1 is the release where the dashboard stopped treating every page load like the first time it had ever heard of your portfolio. The data was already there — it just needed somewhere to live between refreshes.*

Your holdings table now paints from the last saved snapshot the moment the page opens, before a single network request has left the building. Behind the scenes, every service that once scraped Yahoo Finance independently — quotes, analyst recommendations, holding intelligence, earnings dates, move explanations, ETF price signals — now shares a single cached response per ticker, with TTLs that stretch to an hour when the market is closed. A background thread warms those caches on startup so the first real fetch is never cold. Two O(n) hot paths in the Analytics Signals pane became O(1). And a quiet design pass made the verdict mix bar, signal board tiles, and confidence spectrum feel more considered.

v3.1 is a tightening, not a reinvention. The same cockpit, now ready before you sit down.

---

## What's New

### Performance

- **Shared `.info` cache** — six previously independent callers (quotes, analyst recs, holding intelligence, earnings calendar, move explainer, ETF price-zone signal) now draw from one cached Yahoo Finance scrape per ticker via `get_ticker_info()`. TTL is 5 minutes during market hours, 1 hour when closed. Redundant round-trips on a typical dashboard load: gone.
- **Stale-while-revalidate portfolio cache** — on every successful `/api/portfolio/value` response the full payload is written to `localStorage`. On the next page open the holdings table and summary cards render instantly from that snapshot; live prices replace them in place as they arrive.
- **Background startup warmup** — a daemon thread fires immediately on server start, pre-fetching quotes, 1-year history closes, and world market data for all active holdings. The first real dashboard request hits a warm cache rather than a cold scrape.
- **Analytics Signals O(1) lookups** — watchlist filtering and allocation-weight accumulation rebuilt with a `Set` and `Map` respectively, replacing `Array.find` calls inside hot iteration loops.

### UI Polish

- **Verdict mix bar** — taller at 18 px (up from 12), segment gaps with individual rounded end-caps, inset shadow for depth.
- **Signal board tiles** — wider minimum footprint (104 px), taller minimum height (72 px), larger ticker label (0.95 rem), smoother `will-change` lift on hover with border and shadow transition.
- **Confidence spectrum** — band rows separated by hairlines, indicator dot enlarged with a `color-mix` glow ring, ticker pills show a hover state, average confidence value enlarged and set in tabular numerals, `+N more` badge simplified.

### Code Quality

- **Bug fix** — `data_quality` in `holding_intelligence.py` was stuck at `"static"` whenever live country weights or top holdings arrived but live sectors did not. It now correctly reflects `"live"` whenever any live data is present.
- Removed `_normalize_expense_ratio` — the function only cast to `float` and did not perform the normalization its name and docstring claimed; logic is now inline with an accurate comment.
- `stock_service.py` restructured end-to-end: module docstring added, constants and helpers appear before the functions that reference them, `_parallel_fetch()` extracted to deduplicate `get_all_quotes` / `get_portfolio_quotes`, closure `_r()` promoted to module-level `_round_or_none()`.
- Dead function `holdingAllocPct()` in `analytics-charts.js` removed — fully superseded by the `allocByTicker` Map.
- Buried local imports in `holding_intelligence.py` moved to module top (no circular dependency); lazy `import yfinance` inside `etf_price_signal.fetch_etf_price_signal` promoted to module level.
- `event_calendar.py` and `move_explainer.py` migrated to `get_ticker_info()` — they now benefit from the shared cache automatically.

## Developer Notes

- FastAPI metadata version **`3.1.0`**
- Static cache keys: `style.css?v=97`, `dashboard.js?v=90`, `analytics-charts.js?v=13`
- No database schema changes — no migration required.

# FolioOrb v3.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** June 27, 2026

---

## ✦ The Portfolio Stopped Pretending It Was Diversified

> *FolioOrb v3.0 is the release where your book gets treated like a system — overlap, mood, timelines, and three futures with probability bars — instead of a decorative pile of tickers wearing a diversification costume.*

Your portfolio finally has **look-through exposure**, a **market-regime chip**, **peer context**, **earnings risk flags**, **Base/Bull/Bear scenarios**, and an entire **Analytics** tab with five sub-zones and per-chart insight lines. Claude and Local Intelligence now share one engine across briefing, analytics, and verdicts. The navbar got an overflow menu. The pet only wiggles on hover. Very composed. Still judging you.

---

## What's New

### Dashboard &amp; UX

- **Three zones** — Overview, Holdings, and Analytics with persistent tab state
- **Portfolio briefing card** — Claude narrative or deterministic local digest
- **Navbar overflow menu** — theme, text size, pet mode, AI-cost controls in one sheet
- **Semantic color tokens** — green means money up, not "design liked it"
- **Local Intelligence guide** — dismissible banner when Claude is available but Local mode is active
- **Holdings command deck** — action tray, agent status pill (idle / scanning / ready)

### Intelligence &amp; Verdicts

- **Look-through exposure** — sector, country, theme overlap, duplicate detection, HHI concentration
- **Market regime context** — SPY/TLT/VIX/UUP backdrop with cached daily weight shifts
- **Peer-relative positioning** — own-range percentile vs peer median
- **Earnings event awareness** — names inside 14 days get capped confidence and a risk note
- **Time horizons** — `auto` / `trade` / `core` / `anchor` with cycle pill on verdict card
- **Confidence ranges** — `range_low` / `range_high` beside headline score
- **Base / Bull / Bear scenarios** — local paths plus Claude probability splits when AI is connected
- **Claude tension gating** — nudges only when inputs conflict; agreement skips the drama
- **Verdict calibration snapshots** — logged to SQLite for future hit-rate accountability
- **Deep intelligence on expand** — richer context loads async when you open a row

### Analytics *(new zone)*

- **Five sub-tabs** — Performance, Risk, Exposure, Signals, Markets
- Lazy Chart.js visualizations with per-tab insight bar and per-widget tip cards
- Growth projection, correlation matrix, drawdown, beta, rolling vol, sector tilt, conviction gaps, macro alignment, and more

---

## Developer Notes

- FastAPI metadata version **`3.0.0`**
- New services: `portfolio_exposure.py`, `market_regime.py`, `peer_relative.py`, `event_calendar.py`, `verdict_calibration.py`, `verdict_ai_enhancement.py`, `portfolio_analytics.py`, `portfolio_projection.py`, `analytics_insights.py`
- Extended `investment_signal.py` — horizon weights, confidence ranges, scenario builders, modifier hooks
- Extended Claude prompts in `ai_service.py` — disagreement, scenario-probability, briefing, analytics-narrator
- `VerdictSnapshot` model + startup migration for `verdict_snapshots`
- Extended `hold_class` schema — `trade` and `core` alongside `auto` and `anchor`
- New API routes under `/api/portfolio/*`, `/api/ai/portfolio-summary`, `/api/ai/analytics-insights`, `/api/ai/portfolio-exposure`, `/api/ai/verdict-calibration`, `/api/ai/intelligence/{ticker}/deep`, `/api/stocks/world-markets`, `/api/stocks/history/batch`
- Static cache keys: `style.css?v=93`, `dashboard.js?v=88`, `analytics-charts.js?v=9`
- Analytics insights cache version **`widget_insights_version: 2`**
- **`297 tests passing`** — analytics, briefing, projection, intelligence engine UI, calibration, scenarios

# FolioOrb v2.4 Release Notes

**Release date:** June 25, 2026

## Headline

- **`force_local=true`** on `/api/ai/investment-signals/all` — deterministic local quips on demand
- **Persistent mode preference** in browser storage
- **60-second quote cache** — snappier repeated dashboard loads
- **Last-sync resilience** — keeps last good timestamp on failed refresh
- **Sync-state race fix** — HUD commits before render; in-flight guard on portfolio value load

# FolioOrb v2.3 Release Notes

**Release date:** June 2026

## Headline

FolioOrb v2.3 is the graceful-offline release: clearer no-key behavior, sharper local labels, and one less thing for CodeQL to side-eye.

## What's New

- Claude offline setup guidance in the brand callout
- **Local Intelligence Verdict** labels when Claude is disconnected
- Dynamic verdict kicker updates on reconnect
- Day-change rendering polish and timing-signal log sanitization

## Final Word

v2.3 still is not financial advice. It just stopped pretending Claude was whispering when he wasn't in the room.
