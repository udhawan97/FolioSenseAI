"""
Dividend payment calendar — WHEN your holdings pay you, month by month.

The income card answers "how much a year?"; this answers "which months?".
Cadence and paying months are read from each payer's real trailing ex-dates
(yfinance dividend history); the dollar amounts come from the same forward
annual income the income card already shows. History times the payments, the
forward rate sizes them — so a freshly raised dividend projects at the new
rate, in the months the stock has actually been paying.

Honesty rules: the months are EX-DIVIDEND months (cash usually lands days to
weeks later — the payload says so via ``basis``); a payer whose cadence can't
be read from history is listed as ``unscheduled`` with its annual amount,
never spread across months we invented.

``build_income_calendar`` and ``payment_months`` are pure (history and today
injected — trivially unit-testable). Only ``fetch_dividend_ex_dates`` touches
the network, mirroring timing_signal's day-keyed cache + bounded fan-out.
