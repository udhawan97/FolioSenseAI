"""Single owner of the rule "an active holding in this portfolio".

That rule — `portfolio_id == X AND is_active IS TRUE` — used to be written out
verbatim at a dozen query sites, so redefining "active" meant hunting down every
one of them.  It now lives here once, behind a small read-only interface, and
callers ask for the shape they need instead of re-deriving the filter:

    active()                    → ORM rows
    active_by_ticker()          → one ORM row, or None
    active_tickers()            → normalised ticker strings
    active_tickers_or_default() → the same, falling back to DEFAULT_HOLDINGS
    meta_map()                  → ticker → position context

Depth comes from what the implementation absorbs behind those five names: the
filter itself, ticker normalisation, dedup, and one ordering every caller can
lean on.  Widening the rule later (an `archived_at` column, say) is a one-line
edit in this module rather than a twelve-file sweep — that is the locality
payoff.

Ordering guarantee
------------------
Every function returns rows in ascending `Holding.id` — insertion order, oldest
first.  The queries this module replaces carried no ORDER BY and leaned on
SQLite handing back rows in rowid order; stating it turns that accident into a
promise, so callers may depend on it.  Two active rows may share a ticker (the
add-holding endpoint forbids it, nothing in the schema does), and when they do
the oldest wins consistently: it is the row `active_by_ticker()` returns, the
one `active_tickers()` keeps, and the one `meta_map()` describes.

This module reads; it never writes.  It is also deliberately not a query
factory — handing back a `Query` would let callers bolt extra filters onto the
rule this module exists to own, which is exactly the shallowness it replaces.
