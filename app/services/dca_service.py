"""Dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) plan engine — pure, DB-free, network-free.

Mirrors a brokerage auto-invest locally: given a fixed dollar amount, a cadence,
and real historical closing prices, it computes the individual buys (a
"simulated bucket") the user reviews and can then apply to a real holding.

Every function here is pure so it unit-tests without a database or network.
Database orchestration and price fetching live in ``app/routers/dca.py``.
