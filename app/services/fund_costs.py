Fund fee drag — what the funds in a portfolio cost per year, and over time.

No network calls: reads the expense ratio already carried on each quote
(`stock_service.get_stock_data` → ``expense_ratio``). A fund whose ratio is
missing, zero, or implausible is reported as fee-unknown rather than free, and
individual stocks are excluded from coverage entirely — they have no ratio to
be missing.
