"""Database schema versioning and the safe-migration entry point.

The app's tables are created by ``create_all`` and evolved by the idempotent
raw-SQL steps in ``app.database.ensure_startup_migrations``. This module wraps
both in a *protected* sequence:

* An ``app_meta`` key/value table records the on-disk ``schema_version``.
* When the stored version is behind the code's ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` **and** the
  database already holds user data, a verified backup is taken *before* any
  migration runs.
* If the migration then raises, the verified backup is restored and the broken
  database is set aside as ``*.failed-*`` for inspection.

Invariant: holdings data is never mutated by a version-bumping migration without
a recoverable, integrity-checked copy on disk first.
