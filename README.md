> **Because "I don't know why my portfolio is down" is only acceptable once.**
>
> FolioSenseAI tracks your holdings, pulls live prices from Yahoo Finance, and asks Claude AI to explain what on earth is happening — market context, sector moves, macro events, analyst takes. All the excuses reasons you need, in one dashboard.

- Total portfolio value and daily P&L *(color-coded — green good, red bad, you know the drill)*

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

*No blockchain. No NFTs. No regrets.*

| Layer | Technology | Why |

## 🚀 Local Setup

### Fast Install

You'll need **Python 3.11+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On Windows, check **Add Python to PATH** during install.

The Anthropic API key is optional. Without it, FolioSenseAI still runs with live market data and portfolio tracking; AI explanations stay disabled until you add a key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

These commands install the GitHub release [v1.2](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/releases/tag/release-v1.2).

**Mac / Linux**

```bash
curl -L -o FolioSenseAI-v1.2.zip https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/archive/refs/tags/release-v1.2.zip
unzip FolioSenseAI-v1.2.zip
cd FolioSenseAI-release-v1.2
./scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/archive/refs/tags/release-v1.2.zip" -OutFile "FolioSenseAI-v1.2.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "FolioSenseAI-v1.2.zip" -DestinationPath .
cd FolioSenseAI-release-v1.2
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

The setup script creates the virtual environment, installs dependencies, creates `.env`, generates a local secret key, creates the database folder, and starts the app.

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Your local portfolio is created automatically the first time the dashboard asks for data.

### Starting Later

After the first install, use the lighter start script:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

### Optional AI Setup

If you skipped the Anthropic key during setup, open `.env` and set:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

The API key costs a little money per AI query, roughly pennies. AI explanations are cached, so refreshing the dashboard does not keep spending.

### Developer Setup

Prefer doing everything manually? Fair enough.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python run.py
```

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python run.py
```

If PowerShell blocks scripts, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

If yfinance complains about certificates, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

### 🔗 Useful URLs *(once running)*

| URL | What's there |
|-----|-------------|
| `http://localhost:8000` | The dashboard |
| `http://localhost:8000/docs` | Swagger API docs (surprisingly pretty) |
| `http://localhost:8000/health` | Health check endpoint |

---

## 🪄 What's New In v1.2

- Cleaner move explanations for individual stocks: the dashboard no longer shows generic "news activity" unless article evidence is actually surfaced.
- Stronger holding-specific attribution using market, sector, benchmark, volume, and earnings context.
- Regression coverage for stock move explanations so unsupported catalyst claims stay out of the UI.

---

## 🔐 Clean-Slate Fork Safety

This repo is designed so forks start without personal portfolio data:

- `.env` stays local and is ignored by Git.
- SQLite databases and database backups are ignored.
- A fresh database creates an empty local portfolio on first use.
- `DEFAULT_HOLDINGS` is optional and stays in your own `.env` if you want starter tickers.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` defaults to local app origins instead of `*`.

If you previously committed a real database backup, delete it from the current tree and purge it from Git history before treating the public repo as clean.

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

External services are mocked. *(Real integration tests would cost money. Claude is cheap but not free.)*

## 🛡️ GitHub Checks

The repo now has a tiny robot compliance department. It does not wear a tie, but it will absolutely block nonsense.

| Check | What it does | Vibe |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **CI** | Installs dependencies, compiles Python, imports the FastAPI app, and runs the test suite on Python 3.11 and 3.12 | Makes sure the app still has a pulse |
| **Pylint** | Runs static analysis on pull requests and pushes to `main` | Complains professionally |
| **Dependency Audit** | Uses `pip-audit` against `requirements.txt` | Checks whether a package has entered its villain era |
| **Dependency Review** | Reviews dependency changes in pull requests and fails on moderate-or-worse known vulnerabilities | Stops suspicious packages at the door |
| **CodeQL** | Runs GitHub code scanning for Python security and quality issues | Reads the code like it has trust issues |
| **Security Hygiene** | Blocks local secrets, databases, backups, and OS confetti from being tracked | Protects you from committing your digital laundry |
| **Dependabot** | Checks Python packages and GitHub Actions monthly | Gently nags the dependencies into the present |

These checks run on GitHub Actions, so pull requests get the useful red/green lights before anything lands on `main`. If a check fails, read the log before blaming the market. The market is innocent this time. Probably.
