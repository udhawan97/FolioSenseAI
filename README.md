> **v2.1 is here: FolioSenseAI now reads your portfolio like an analyst with a personality.**
>
> FolioSenseAI tracks your holdings, pulls live prices from Yahoo Finance, and asks Claude AI to explain what on earth is happening — market context, sector moves, macro events, analyst takes, and now a clearer Add / Hold / Trim read. All the excuses reasons you need, in one dashboard.

## 🚀 Local Setup

### Before You Start

You do not need to be a developer to run FolioSenseAI locally. Think of this like installing a small private dashboard on your own computer:

- Install **Python 3.11 or newer** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On Windows, make sure **Add Python to PATH** is checked during install.
- Use **Terminal** on Mac or Linux. Use **PowerShell** on Windows.
- Copy and paste one command block at a time. If a prompt asks for an Anthropic API key, paste it or press **Enter** to skip AI features for now.
- Keep the Terminal or PowerShell window open while using the app. Closing it stops the local server.
- The dashboard runs only on your computer at `http://localhost:8000`; it is not publishing your portfolio to the internet.

### Fast Install

The Anthropic API key is optional. Without it, FolioSenseAI still runs with live market data and portfolio tracking; AI explanations stay disabled until you add a key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

These commands install the GitHub release [v2.1](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/releases/tag/release-v2.1).

**Mac / Linux**

```bash
curl -L -o FolioSenseAI-v2.1.zip https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/archive/refs/tags/release-v2.1.zip
unzip FolioSenseAI-v2.1.zip
cd FolioSenseAI-release-v2.1
./scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/archive/refs/tags/release-v2.1.zip" -OutFile "FolioSenseAI-v2.1.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "FolioSenseAI-v2.1.zip" -DestinationPath .
cd FolioSenseAI-release-v2.1
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

The setup script creates the virtual environment, installs dependencies, creates `.env`, generates a local secret key, creates the database folder, and starts the app.

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Your local portfolio is created automatically the first time the dashboard asks for data.

### What Success Looks Like

When setup works, your Terminal or PowerShell window will say:

```text
Starting FolioSenseAI at http://localhost:8000
```

Leave that window running, then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox.

### Starting Later

After the first install, use the lighter start script:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

### Optional AI Setup

If you skipped the Anthropic key during setup, open `.env` and set:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

The API key costs a little money per AI query, roughly pennies. AI explanations are cached, so refreshing the dashboard does not keep spending.

#### Getting Your Own Anthropic API Key

This is the tiny toll booth that lets FolioSenseAI ask Claude for portfolio explanations. Your brokerage anxiety remains locally sourced.

1. Go to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in or create an account.
2. Open the API keys area. Anthropic may ask you to create a workspace or add billing first; this is normal capitalism, sadly.
3. Create a new API key and give it a boring name like `FolioSenseAI Local`.
4. Copy the key right away. Treat it like a password with better vocabulary.
5. Open the `.env` file in the FolioSenseAI folder and paste it like this:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-real-key-goes-here
```

6. Save `.env`, stop the app with `Ctrl+C`, then restart it:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

Tips before Claude starts analyzing your portfolio with unsettling calm:

- Do not paste your API key into GitHub, screenshots, Slack, email, or anywhere public. If it leaks, delete it in the Anthropic Console and create a new one.
- Start with a small billing limit if Anthropic offers one. The app caches AI responses, but budgets are cheaper than surprises.
- The Claude web subscription and the Anthropic API are separate. Having Claude Pro does not automatically make API usage free.
- You can leave the key blank. The dashboard still tracks holdings and market data; it just loses the AI therapist chair.

### Quick Fixes

| If you see this | Try this |
|-----------------|----------|
| `Python 3.11+ is required` | Install the latest Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then close and reopen Terminal or PowerShell. |
| PowerShell blocks the script | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`, then run the setup command again. |
| `Permission denied` on Mac/Linux | Run `chmod +x scripts/setup.sh scripts/start.sh`, then try `./scripts/setup.sh` again. |
| Browser says the site cannot be reached | Make sure the Terminal or PowerShell window is still running and shows `http://localhost:8000`. |
| Port `8000` is already in use | Close the other local app using that port, or stop it and run the start script again. |
| AI features are disabled | Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here` to `.env`, save it, then restart the app. |
| Market data looks delayed or unavailable | Wait a minute and refresh. Yahoo Finance data can be delayed, rate-limited, or unavailable outside market hours. |

### Developer Setup

Prefer doing everything manually? Fair enough.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python run.py
```

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python run.py
```

If PowerShell blocks scripts, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

If yfinance complains about certificates, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

## 🪄 What's New In v2.1

**FolioSenseAI v2.1 adds conviction to the verdict — mark what you're keeping, lock in long-term positions, and get cleaner signals on everything else.**

- Added **Anchor Hold** — designate any position as a long-term anchor directly from its verdict card or the Manage Holdings panel; anchored positions are never flagged for trimming, and Folio Sense surfaces add signals on dips below their own price trend instead.
- Added **AI Recommendations panel** — a dedicated section that surfaces the full Folio Sense × Claude verdict per holding in a focused, scrollable view alongside the dashboard.
- Improved **analyst review validation** — tighter checks on analyst consensus fields prevent bad data from inflating or deflating confidence scores.
- Polished **verdict card UI** — cleaner layout for action chips, confidence meter, anchor pill, and reasons/risks; better spacing and typography across the dashboard.
- Fixed **anchor state persistence** — hold_class now round-trips correctly between the verdict engine and the manage-holdings panel.

### v2.1 Release Notes

**For users:** v2.1 is about commitment — you can now tell Folio Sense which positions are untouchable. Mark a holding as an Anchor and the app shifts from "should I trim?" to "when's the best moment to add more?" Everything else continues to get Add / Hold / Trim verdicts as before.

**For developers:** v2.1 adds `hold_class` (anchor / auto) to the investment signal model, a toggle API on the portfolio holdings endpoint, CSS and JS validation improvements, and stricter analyst-recommendation parsing for edge-case tickers.

---

## 🪄 What's New In v2.0

**FolioSenseAI v2 turns the dashboard from "what moved?" into "what should I pay attention to next?"**

- Added **Folio Sense × Claude verdicts** for each holding: Add, Hold, Trim, or Needs Data, with confidence, reasons, risks, and a cached AI quip.
- Added **market mood** to investment signals, so live momentum can soften or strengthen marginal calls instead of blindly following analyst ratings.
- Added a **portfolio health read** that summarizes the book's dominant action mix and concentration band in one business-friendly line.
- Added **ETF holdings fallback** for cases where Yahoo Finance has no top-holdings data; Claude can seed estimated ETF constituents on retry and marks them as estimated.
- Added richer **AI verdict UI**: reveal animation, branded "Folio Sense × Claude" copy, confidence meter, action chips, loading lines, and clearer risks/reasons.
- Added **performance date ranges** for 1W, 1M, 1Y, 3Y, and Max views.
- Improved ETF price-signal data quality checks, including sparse-history warnings and split-adjustment mismatch protection.
- Expanded tests across investment signals, verdict caching, ETF price-signal warnings, AI quip parsing, and ETF holdings fallback.

### Release Notes

**For users and business folks:** v2 makes FolioSenseAI more decision-oriented. Instead of only explaining portfolio movement, the app now highlights whether each position looks like an add, hold, trim, or needs-more-data candidate, and explains the why in plain language.

**For developers:** v2 adds a deterministic investment-signal service, new AI verdict endpoints, batched/cached Claude quips, action-and-market-mood cache keys, portfolio-level verdict state, ETF constituent fallback generation, richer dashboard rendering, and broader regression coverage.

**Compared with v1.3:** the app moves beyond companion reactions and movement explanations into a fuller recommendation-style workflow, while keeping the same local-first setup and no-brokerage-connection posture.

## 🔐 Clean-Slate Fork Safety

This repo is designed so forks start without personal portfolio data:

- `.env` stays local and is ignored by Git.
- SQLite databases and database backups are ignored.
- A fresh database creates an empty local portfolio on first use.
- `DEFAULT_HOLDINGS` is optional and stays in your own `.env` if you want starter tickers.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` defaults to local app origins instead of `*`.

If you previously committed a real database backup, delete it from the current tree and purge it from Git history before treating the public repo as clean.

## 🛡️ GitHub Checks

The repo now has a tiny robot compliance department. It does not wear a tie, but it will absolutely block nonsense.

| Check | What it does | Vibe |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **CI** | Installs dependencies, compiles Python, imports the FastAPI app, and runs the test suite on Python 3.11 and 3.12 | Makes sure the app still has a pulse |
| **Pylint** | Runs static analysis on pull requests and pushes to `main` | Complains professionally |
| **Dependency Audit** | Uses `pip-audit` against `requirements.txt` | Checks whether a package has entered its villain era |
| **Dependency Review** | Reviews dependency changes in pull requests and fails on moderate-or-worse known vulnerabilities | Stops suspicious packages at the door |
| **CodeQL** | Runs GitHub code scanning for Python security and quality issues | Reads the code like it has trust issues |
| **Security Hygiene** | Blocks local secrets, databases, backups, and OS confetti from being tracked | Protects you from committing your digital laundry |
| **Dependabot** | Checks Python packages and GitHub Actions monthly | Gently nags the dependencies into the present |

These checks run on GitHub Actions, so pull requests get the useful red/green lights before anything lands on `main`. If a check fails, read the log before blaming the market. The market is innocent this time. Probably.
