> **v2.4 is here: FolioSenseAI now lets Claude and Local Intelligence take turns without making it weird.**
>
> FolioSenseAI tracks your holdings, pulls live prices from Yahoo Finance, validates tickers before they enter the portfolio, and lets you choose between Claude-backed quips or deterministic Local Intelligence for verdicts. v2.4 adds a polished mode toggle, snappier quote caching, and a last-sync HUD that keeps its composure when market data has a little moment. Very adult. Still hot.

## 🚀 Local Setup

### Before You Start

You do not need to be a developer to run FolioSenseAI locally. Think of this like installing a small private dashboard on your own computer:

- Install **Python 3.11 or newer** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On Windows, make sure **Add Python to PATH** is checked during install.
- Use **Terminal** on Mac or Linux. Use **PowerShell** on Windows.
- Copy and paste one command block at a time. If a prompt asks for an Anthropic API key, paste it or press **Enter** to skip AI features for now.
- Keep the Terminal or PowerShell window open while using the app. Closing it stops the local server.
- The dashboard runs only on your computer at `http://localhost:8000`; it is not publishing your portfolio to the internet.

### Fast Install

The Anthropic API key is optional. Without it, FolioSenseAI still runs with live market data and portfolio tracking; AI explanations stay disabled until you add a key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

These commands install the GitHub release [v2.4](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/releases/tag/release-v2.4).

**Mac / Linux**

```bash
curl -L -o FolioSenseAI-v2.4.zip https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/archive/refs/tags/release-v2.4.zip
unzip FolioSenseAI-v2.4.zip
cd FolioSenseAI-release-v2.4
./scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioSenseAI/archive/refs/tags/release-v2.4.zip" -OutFile "FolioSenseAI-v2.4.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "FolioSenseAI-v2.4.zip" -DestinationPath .
cd FolioSenseAI-release-v2.4
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

The setup script creates the virtual environment, installs dependencies, creates `.env`, generates a local secret key, creates the database folder, and starts the app.

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Your local portfolio is created automatically the first time the dashboard asks for data.

### What Success Looks Like

When setup works, your Terminal or PowerShell window will say:

```text
Starting FolioSenseAI at http://localhost:8000
```

Leave that window running, then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox.

### Starting Later

After the first install, use the lighter start script:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

### Optional AI Setup

If you skipped the Anthropic key during setup, open `.env` and set:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

The API key costs a little money per AI query, roughly pennies. AI explanations are cached, so refreshing the dashboard does not keep spending.

#### Getting Your Own Anthropic API Key

This is the tiny toll booth that lets FolioSenseAI ask Claude for portfolio explanations. Your brokerage anxiety remains locally sourced.

1. Go to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in or create an account.
2. Open the API keys area. Anthropic may ask you to create a workspace or add billing first; this is normal capitalism, sadly.
3. Create a new API key and give it a boring name like `FolioSenseAI Local`.
4. Copy the key right away. Treat it like a password with better vocabulary.
5. Open the `.env` file in the FolioSenseAI folder and paste it like this:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-real-key-goes-here
```

6. Save `.env`, stop the app with `Ctrl+C`, then restart it:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

Tips before Claude starts analyzing your portfolio with unsettling calm:

- Do not paste your API key into GitHub, screenshots, Slack, email, or anywhere public. If it leaks, delete it in the Anthropic Console and create a new one.
- Start with a small billing limit if Anthropic offers one. The app caches AI responses, but budgets are cheaper than surprises.
- The Claude web subscription and the Anthropic API are separate. Having Claude Pro does not automatically make API usage free.
- You can leave the key blank. The dashboard still tracks holdings and market data; it just loses the AI therapist chair.

### Quick Fixes

| If you see this | Try this |
|-----------------|----------|
| `Python 3.11+ is required` | Install the latest Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then close and reopen Terminal or PowerShell. |
| PowerShell blocks the script | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`, then run the setup command again. |
| `Permission denied` on Mac/Linux | Run `chmod +x scripts/setup.sh scripts/start.sh`, then try `./scripts/setup.sh` again. |
| Browser says the site cannot be reached | Make sure the Terminal or PowerShell window is still running and shows `http://localhost:8000`. |
| Port `8000` is already in use | Close the other local app using that port, or stop it and run the start script again. |
| AI features are disabled | Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here` to `.env`, save it, then restart the app. |
| Market data looks delayed or unavailable | Wait a minute and refresh. Yahoo Finance data can be delayed, rate-limited, or unavailable outside market hours. |

### Developer Setup

Prefer doing everything manually? Fair enough.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python run.py
```

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python run.py
```

If PowerShell blocks scripts, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

If yfinance complains about certificates, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

### 🔗 Useful URLs *(once running)*

| URL | What's there |
|-----|-------------|
| `http://localhost:8000` | The dashboard |
| `http://localhost:8000/docs` | Swagger API docs (surprisingly pretty) |
| `http://localhost:8000/health` | Health check endpoint |

## 🪄 What's New In v2.4

**FolioSenseAI v2.4 is the mode-control release: Claude when you want the charm, Local Intelligence when you want deterministic quiet, and fresher-feeling market data without extra drama.**

- Added a **Claude AI / Local Intel toggle** in the top bar so you can skip Claude quip generation for the session while keeping the rest of the dashboard live.
- Added `force_local=true` support to `/api/ai/investment-signals/all`, returning deterministic fallback quips without spending Claude calls.
- Added persistent local-mode preference via browser storage, with verdict labels and helper copy updating in place.
- Added a 60-second quote cache around Yahoo Finance calls to make repeated dashboard loads and validations snappier.
- Improved the **Last synced** HUD behavior so failed refreshes keep the last good timestamp and explain when stale prices are being shown.
- Fixed a race condition where overlapping `loadPortfolioValue` calls could fight over the chart canvas and produce false "Refresh failed" flashes; HUD state is now committed before rendering so a rendering error never clears a good sync time.
- Tightened the percentage column in the target-trend list so triple-digit values never wrap or truncate.
- Polished the mode toggle placement, disabled/offline state, and dashboard pet copy so Claude and Local Intelligence can share the room like adults with excellent boundaries.

### v2.4 Release Notes

**For users:** v2.4 gives you a clean choice: let Claude add personality to verdicts, or switch to Local Intel for deterministic, no-API quips. The dashboard also feels faster on repeat quote reads and behaves more gracefully when a refresh fails.

**For developers:** v2.4 bumps the FastAPI app to `2.4.0`, adds the `force_local` query path on the batch investment-signal endpoint, introduces a short-lived quote cache in `stock_service`, updates dashboard fetches to honor forced-local mode, adds an in-flight guard and pre-render HUD commit to fix sync-state race conditions, widens the percentage column in the target-trend list, and bumps the dashboard script cache key.

---

## 🪄 What's New In v2.3

**FolioSenseAI v2.3 is the graceful-offline release: clearer no-key behavior, sharper local labels, cleaner day-change polish, and one less thing for CodeQL to side-eye.**

- Added **Claude offline setup guidance** directly in the brand callout, including the Anthropic Console link, `.env` key name, and restart steps.
- Updated verdict copy so offline results show **Local Intelligence Verdict** instead of implying Claude is actively whispering into the dashboard.
- Added dynamic verdict kicker updates so reconnecting Claude restores the Folio Sense × Claude label automatically.
- Improved **day-change rendering** with a reusable styled cell, cleaner caret alignment, and less inline styling.
- Hardened timing-signal logging by sanitizing untrusted ticker values before they reach log output.
- Preserved the local-first experience: live market data, deterministic signals, portfolio math, and cached/fallback notes still work when Claude is offline.

### v2.3 Release Notes

**For users:** v2.3 makes FolioSenseAI much less cryptic when Claude is not connected. The app now shows what is local, what is AI-backed, and exactly how to restore Claude. No guessing, no séance, no “why is this button judging me?” energy.

**For developers:** v2.3 bumps the FastAPI app to `2.3.0`, updates dashboard release metadata, sanitizes ticker values in timing-signal logging, replaces inline day-change icon styling with CSS, and improves offline/online verdict label synchronization in `dashboard.js`.


## 🔐 Clean-Slate Fork Safety

This repo is designed so forks start without personal portfolio data:

- `.env` stays local and is ignored by Git.
- SQLite databases and database backups are ignored.
- A fresh database creates an empty local portfolio on first use.
- `DEFAULT_HOLDINGS` is optional and stays in your own `.env` if you want starter tickers.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` defaults to local app origins instead of `*`.

If you previously committed a real database backup, delete it from the current tree and purge it from Git history before treating the public repo as clean.

## 🛡️ GitHub Checks

The repo now has a tiny robot compliance department. It does not wear a tie, but it will absolutely block nonsense.

| Check | What it does | Vibe |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **CI** | Installs dependencies, compiles Python, imports the FastAPI app, and runs the test suite on Python 3.11 and 3.12 | Makes sure the app still has a pulse |
| **Pylint** | Runs static analysis on pull requests and pushes to `main` | Complains professionally |
| **Dependency Audit** | Uses `pip-audit` against `requirements.txt` | Checks whether a package has entered its villain era |
| **Dependency Review** | Reviews dependency changes in pull requests and fails on moderate-or-worse known vulnerabilities | Stops suspicious packages at the door |
| **CodeQL** | Runs GitHub code scanning for Python security and quality issues | Reads the code like it has trust issues |
| **Security Hygiene** | Blocks local secrets, databases, backups, and OS confetti from being tracked | Protects you from committing your digital laundry |
| **Dependabot** | Checks Python packages and GitHub Actions monthly | Gently nags the dependencies into the present |

These checks run on GitHub Actions, so pull requests get the useful red/green lights before anything lands on `main`. If a check fails, read the log before blaming the market. The market is innocent this time. Probably.
