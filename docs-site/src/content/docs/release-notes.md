The full changelog lives in
[`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
in the repository. Highlights of the current release below.

## v5.7.0 — Reasons and Seasons

- **Your thesis, on every holding.** Each expanded holding gets a box for the reason you own
  it, in your own words. Claude never reads or writes it, it round-trips through CSV, and a
  background refresh can't clobber an edit in progress.
- **A dividend calendar.** The income card now shows which months pay you, not just the annual
  total — twelve bars built from each payer's real trailing ex-dates, so a monthly REIT and a
  quarterly stock land in their own months rather than an assumed rhythm.
- **Honest about what the months mean.** They're ex-dividend months — the cutoffs to own each
  payer — and the card says so, since cash lands later. A payer whose schedule can't be read
  from history is named as unscheduled, never smeared across months nobody observed.
- Installing over v5.6.0 keeps the existing database, holdings, trades, DCA history, settings,
  and API key. No schema migration is required.

## v5.6.0 — Inside Out

- **Insider activity (SEC Form 4).** Recent open-market buys and sells by a company's own
  officers and directors, in each stock's expanded detail. Grants, gifts, and tax withholding
  are shown but never counted as conviction; funds have no insiders and say so.
- **Financials over time (SEC XBRL).** Revenue, net margin, and diluted EPS by fiscal year
  from filed numbers, with revenue history stitched across the 2018 GAAP tag change. Missing
  metrics stay blank, never a fabricated zero.
- **Dividend income view.** Annual cash your holdings pay you at your position size, blended
  yield, and an ex-dividend heads-up. Non-payers are named, never counted as $0.
- **Filings in plain English.** 8-K item codes are labelled by what they report ("Results
  announced," "Officer or director change") instead of raw numbers.
- **Fixed: low-yield dividend yields read 100× too high.** yfinance reports dividend yield in
  two fields 100× apart; a sub-1% yield rendered as tens of percent. Normalized once at the
  source — Apple now reads 0.32%, not 32%.
- Installing over v5.5.0 keeps the existing database, holdings, trades, DCA history, settings,
  and API key. No schema migration is required.

## v5.5.0 — Straight From the Source

- **The filings, unfiltered.** The News tab shows what your companies actually told the SEC —
  8-K, 10-Q, 10-K — pulled from EDGAR and linked to the source document. Funds and crypto are
  named as non-filers, never shown as companies that filed nothing. No Claude key needed.
- **The curve, and where fear actually sits.** The market backdrop reads the US Treasury yield
  curve (2s10s, 3m10y) and reports where the VIX sits in its own five-year range. An inverted
  curve nudges verdicts toward quality; flat, normal, and steep are reported and left alone.
- **What your funds cost you.** Expense ratios as real dollars per year and over a decade,
  with the growth assumption stated next to the projection. A fee that can't be read stays
  unknown — never a quiet $0.
- **Whether your ETFs are the same bet.** Pairwise overlap across your funds' top 10 published
  holdings, labeled for exactly what it measures.
- **Earnings with the bar attached.** The radar carries the consensus EPS estimate and the
  recent beat record alongside the date.
- **Fixed: fund fees read 100× too high.** An expense ratio could be scored in the most
  expensive tier when it was among the cheapest, dragging that fund's quality score. Ratios are
  now normalized once, at the source.
- Installing over v5.4.2 keeps the existing database, holdings, trades, DCA history, settings,
  and API key. No schema migration is required.

## v5.4.2 — Honest Valuation, Safer Ledgers

- **Return math now matches the full investment.** Portfolio total-return percentage includes
  the cost basis of both open and already-sold shares, matching the realized + unrealized gain
  shown beside it.
- **Bad quotes never become a confident read.** Zero, non-finite, malformed, or missing prices
  are labeled unavailable; incomplete valuations do not write daily snapshots or generate
  portfolio-level Claude briefings, analytics narration, or action plans.
- **Applied DCA buys stay traceable.** Undo applied buys before deleting their plan so the
  contribution ledger and holding mutation cannot drift apart.
- **Cleaner architecture and public docs.** Lifecycle, valuation, DCA, and narrative caching now
  have focused service interfaces, while the landing page and docs share a sharper visual system.
- Installing over v5.4.1 keeps the existing database, holdings, trades, DCA history, settings,
  and API key. No schema migration is required.

## v5.4.1 — Per-Portfolio Verdict History

- **Your track record follows the portfolio.** The Signals "how did my past calls age?" report
  card and calibration stats now scope to the portfolio you're viewing, instead of blending Add /
  Trim / Hold calls across all of them.
- Verdicts logged before this update are kept and attributed to your default portfolio (additive
  schema v4 migration). Installing over any 5.4.0 keeps everything in place.

## v5.4.0 — More Than One Portfolio

- **Multiple portfolios.** A switcher in the top bar lets you create, rename, delete, and switch
  between portfolios — give your taxable account, IRA, and experiments their own scoreboards.
- **Everything re-scopes.** Value, P&L, holdings, every analytics chart, news, DCA plans, and the
  AI briefings/action-plans all follow the portfolio you're viewing. The Manage panel names the
  one you're editing.
- **Cleanly separated.** Each portfolio's data — including its cached AI narratives (namespaced
  per portfolio) — stays its own; switching never shows another portfolio's content. "My
  Portfolio" is always present and can't be deleted; new portfolios start empty.
- Installing over any 5.3.x keeps your holdings as the default portfolio.

## v5.3.1 — Accurate Sales, Working Links

- **Record a sale at the real price and date.** Reducing a holding now lets you enter the actual
  sale price and date (pre-filled with today's, but editable) — so a sale you made last month
  books into your realized P&L and year-end recap correctly, in the right tax year. Leave the
  price blank to use the live market price.
- **External links work in the desktop app.** Links like console.anthropic.com (to get a Claude
  key) and the docs now open in your real browser instead of a dead in-app frame.
- Installing over any 5.3.0 keeps everything in place.

## v5.3.0 — Honest When Things Go Wrong

- **Never a scary $0.** If market data can't be reached, the dashboard keeps your last-known
  values and shows an honest "unavailable" status instead of $0 with a green "synced" check —
  and it no longer writes that $0 into your performance history (which left a permanent fake
  cliff in the P&L/drawdown charts).
- **Honest about your Claude key.** Saving a key now verifies it actually reaches Anthropic
  before claiming "connected," you can disconnect Claude from the key panel, and the offline
  setup steps point at the one-click panel instead of "edit .env and restart in a terminal."
- **No accidental sales from a typo.** Reducing a holding's share count now asks before booking
  a realized sale, and mid-typing keystrokes no longer book phantom sales.
- **Smaller edges filed down.** First-run/empty portfolios get an "Add your first holding"
  prompt; remove/world-markets/news failures surface clearly instead of silently; stale hero
  tiles clear on an empty portfolio; and Cmd/Ctrl shortcuts no longer double-fire.
- Installing over any 5.2.x keeps everything in place.

## v5.2.1 — DCA, Polished

- **Bulk actions ask first.** "Apply all" and "Skip all" now confirm with the count and dollar
  total, and each plan gets an **Undo applied** action that reverses a whole backfill in one move.
- **Pause means pause.** Resuming a paused plan no longer retroactively books the buys skipped
  while it was paused — it picks up from the resume date.
- **Sharper edges filed down.** Undoing a buy that empties a holding now retires that holding
  (no $0 leftover); an exact-duplicate plan is blocked; same-ticker plans are told apart in the
  bucket; large backfills render lightly; and double-taps can't fire a duplicate action.
- Installing over any 5.2.0 keeps all plans, holdings, and settings (additive schema v3).

## v5.2.0 — Auto-Invest, On Your Terms

- **DCA auto-invest plans, simulated locally.** The most-asked question — "can it sync my
  broker's auto-invest?" — answered the local-first way. Set a ticker, a dollar amount, and a
  cadence (daily / weekly / monthly); each interval books a buy at that day's *real* close into
  a review bucket. Weekends and holidays snap to the next trading day.
- **Nothing moves until you say so.** Every booked buy waits for you to **Apply** it (shares and
  average cost update), **Skip** it, or leave it. Applies are reversible with **Undo**; skips can
  be **Restored**. A past start date backfills the full history, with a double-count guard if you
  already hold the ticker.
- **Catches up after you've been away.** Reopen the app after a week and it fills in every missed
  buy, idempotently — never double-booking. A badge shows how many are waiting.
- Installing over any 5.1.x keeps all holdings, settings, and `.env`. Still no brokerage
  connection; still not financial advice.

## v5.1.0 — Looking Back, Honestly

- **Year-end realized recap.** The Realized gains tab now opens with a year-by-year recap of
  your closed trades — realized P&L and return, sales and tickers covered, winners vs losers,
  and the best and worst position of the year. Reads every stored trade from your local
  database; no live quotes. Switch years with the toggle.
- **A verdict report card.** The Signals tab grades FolioOrb's own past Add / Trim / Hold calls
  by how each holding has done *since* the call — an overall "aged well" rate, a per-action
  breakdown, and a ledger with a ✓/✗ per call. A look-back, not a forward bet; small samples
  are noisy and it's not financial advice.
- Installing over any 5.0.x keeps all holdings, settings, and `.env`.

## v5.0.0 — FolioOrb

FolioOrb is the native desktop app for local-first portfolio intelligence.

- **FolioOrb everywhere** — app window, installers (`FolioOrb-macOS-arm64-*.dmg`,
  `FolioOrb-Windows-x64-*-Setup.exe`), docs, and repository at
  [github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb).
- **Data stays local** in the normal per-user app data directory for your
  platform.
- **Privacy posture stays clear** — FolioOrb is local-first, Claude-optional,
  never places trades, and reports to nobody.

## v4.5.2 — Reliability patch

A full-codebase bug audit and the fixes it surfaced — no new features, just
sturdier numbers and safer data.

- **Bad market data no longer poisons your analytics.** A zero or negative close
  (a halted or delisted ticker, a data glitch) used to contaminate annualized
  return, volatility, and correlation with `NaN`; those days are now treated as
  flat. Correlation reports "no data" honestly when a frozen price series makes
  it undefined, instead of faking a `0.0`.
- **Trim verdicts score the right way round** — a cheap stock is no longer handed
  a high-confidence *trim*.
- **A failed rollback can never leave you with no database.** Restore now stages
  and re-verifies the backup before touching your live database, and tells you
  clearly if data restored but settings didn't.
- **Watchlist edits never fabricate P&L**, the batch price-history endpoint
  validates its `period`, plus assorted updater, cache, and logging hardening.

No migration or `.env` change required.

## v4.5.1 — Export That Actually Exports

- **Fixed: CSV export and the import template now download in the desktop app.** The
  packaged app is a native window with no download chrome, so **Export CSV** and **Download
  template** used to open the file inline as raw text — no Save dialog, no back button. Both
  now route through a native **Save As…** dialog and write a real `.csv` (UTF-8 with the BOM
  Excel expects). Browsers download exactly as before. Either way, you get a file, not a
  dead end.
- **Website polish** — Senpai gets his own animated spotlight above the footer, a refreshed
  one-liner pill, and CSV import is now called out in the workflow walkthrough.
- Installing over v4.5.0 keeps all holdings, settings, and `.env`. Nothing about your data
  changes.

## v4.5.0 — The Spreadsheet Release

- **Export your holdings as CSV.** One click in the portfolio manager downloads your active
  holdings and watchlist as a clean, Excel-ready CSV — with every cell escaped against
  spreadsheet formula injection. The file you get *is* the import template.
- **Import holdings, two ways.** *Local* (always available, no API key) does a strict,
  exact-schema parse of the template — deterministic, free, offline, and never gated.
  *Claude assist* (when a key is set) maps almost any brokerage export onto the FolioOrb
  format for you, and every mapped row still passes the same strict validation before it
  touches your book. Clean template files skip Claude entirely.
- **A per-row report either way** — added, skipped (duplicates are skipped, never
  overwritten), or errored with a plain-English reason — plus a Senpai-narrated recap in
  Claude mode. Safety as usual: a 256 KB / 200-row import cap and content-type checks.

## v4.4.1 — Software Update, done right

- **Fixed: the updater falsely showing "You're offline."** The packaged app's bundled OpenSSL
  pointed at a build-machine certificate path that doesn't exist on your Mac, so every update
  check failed TLS verification and was reported as "offline" even when you were connected. Now
  fixed at the root — the checker verifies against a CA bundle shipped inside the app — and
  failure states are told apart instead of lumped together ("Couldn't securely check for
  updates," "GitHub rate limit reached," etc., each with its own diagnostic).
- **Real in-app updates on macOS**, not just "open the DMG." Update Now downloads, verifies,
  backs up your data, swaps in the new app, and relaunches automatically. Windows keeps its
  one-click silent install.
- **A consent-first in-app update system.** FolioOrb checks quietly for new versions, shows
  a calm indicator when one's available, and never downloads or installs without an explicit
  click. Check any time from **Check for Updates…** in the app menu or **Settings → Software
  Update**.
- **Your holdings are protected at every step.** A verified backup is taken before any update or
  migration; if the backup can't be made or fails verification, the update pauses rather than
  risking your data. **Restore previous version…** rolls back safely, always snapshotting current
  data first so nothing is lost either way.
- **Trustworthy downloads.** SHA-256 verified against published checksums, with optional minisign
  authenticity signing. Release notes render as text, not raw HTML.
- Built in eight phases, then hardened through repeated rounds of adversarial review — against
  both source and the actual installed app — that caught and fixed the offline/TLS root cause plus
  nine other real issues, including a data-loss gap in backup verification, an XSS path in
  release-notes rendering, and a macOS "quit unexpectedly" crash on every exit. 256 dedicated
  tests, `pylint` 10.00.

## v4.3.4 — Quieter Hot Paths

- **Performance release — no feature changes.** Targeted fixes to the code that runs most
  often, so the dashboard stays smooth as portfolios and interactions scale up. Installing
  over v4.3.3 or earlier keeps all holdings, settings, and `.env`.
- **Currency formatting no longer allocates per value** — every dollar figure was built with
  a freshly constructed `Intl.NumberFormat`, which is far more expensive than the formatting
  itself. The currency and world-market formatters are now built once and reused. Output is
  byte-for-byte identical.
- **The correlation heatmap stops rebuilding its canvas on hover** — the hover redraw was
  reassigning the canvas's pixel dimensions every time, which reallocates and clears the whole
  backing store even when the size is unchanged. It now only resizes the bitmap when the
  dimensions actually change.
- **Hover and resize work is coalesced to one pass per frame** — the heatmap's `mousemove`
  handler and the two dashboard-zone indicator resize handlers are throttled to
  `requestAnimationFrame`, so at most one layout read/redraw runs per frame.
- **Fixed misleading "AI failed" warnings when no Claude API key is configured** — running
  key-free (the default Local Intelligence mode) logged every briefing/insights/action-plan
  request as a warning-level failure, even though it's the expected, harmless case. These now
  log at debug with an accurate message; a genuine failure with a key present still warns.
- **Fixed the greyed-out Engine toggle opening the wrong panel** — tapping the disabled
  "Local Intel" control (no API key set) opened the passive intro card instead of the
  interactive **Connect Claude AI** panel. It now opens that panel directly — paste a key,
  hit Save & Connect, no restart — and closes the menu first so it isn't covered.
- **Verified:** the full 381-test suite passes, `pylint` holds at 10.00/10, and the theme,
  spacing, typography, and animations are untouched — these changes affect only how existing
  work is scheduled and routed, not what is drawn.

## v4.3.3 — One Range, Every Section

- **Feature release.** The Overview time-range switcher (Today / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y) gains a
  **1W** option and now drives the sector/movers panel, the portfolio briefing, and the
  allocation focus read — not just the P&L card. Installing over v4.3.2 or earlier keeps all
  holdings, settings, and `.env`.
- **One shared range.** All four sections read from a single selected time range instead of
  managing their own state, so switching to 3M means Insights, Briefing, Allocation, and
  P&L all narrate the same three months.
- **Fixed a real inconsistency** caught during testing: the hero P&L card needed weeks of the
  app's own usage history to compute longer ranges, so a newer portfolio could show
  "1M P&L: --" directly above a movers panel already showing a real number for that month
  from actual market price history. The hero card now falls back to the same price-history
  calculation so both agree.
- **Performance:** all five non-day ranges come from one new endpoint in a single request,
  cached per holdings set so revisiting a range is instant with no network call. Rapid
  switching never flashes stale data, each section fails independently with its own
  inline retry, and manual refresh now refreshes range data too.

## v4.3.2 — Scrolling, Finished

- **Performance release — no feature changes.** Second half of the v4.3.1 scroll fix,
  this time aimed at portfolios with a real number of holdings in them. Installing over
  v4.3.1 or earlier keeps all holdings, settings, and `.env`.
- **Fixed a sparkline redraw bug** — each holding's 7-day trend canvas was repainting
  every time it scrolled into view, even when its price history hadn't changed. It now
  only redraws when the data actually changes, verified pixel-for-pixel.
- **Fixed the real cost** — switching away from the Holdings tab hid it with
  `visibility: hidden`, which keeps a hidden element fully "in play" for layout. With
  enough holdings, that table's column-width math is expensive, and it was being
  recomputed on every scroll frame on *every* tab — not just Holdings. It's now skipped
  entirely while off-screen (`content-visibility: hidden`) and restored instantly on switch.
- **Result:** roughly 4× faster scrolling on Overview and Holdings with a 30-holding
  portfolio, with Analytics and News both meaningfully smoother too.

## v4.3.1 — Smooth Scrolling in the Desktop App

- **Performance release — no feature changes.** The native app scrolled sluggishly on
  macOS; v4.3.1 fixes it. Installing over v4.3.0 keeps all holdings, settings, and `.env`.
- **Fixed the universal scroll killers** — the ambient background moved off the scrolling
  page onto a fixed, compositor-cached layer (`background-attachment: fixed` repainted the
  whole gradient every frame), and the drifting background orbs lost a heavy `blur(40px)`
  filter that was re-rasterized each frame. Both help the browser and from-source runs too.
- **Desktop-app rendering profile** — inside the system WebView (WKWebView / WebView2) the
  app now drops `backdrop-filter` and freezes a few always-on ambient animations, which
  those engines render expensively. Frosted surfaces fall back to near-opaque fills, so the
  look holds up; the in-browser experience is left at full fidelity.
- **Result:** ~3× smoother scroll frame rate on the overview and analytics views in
  throttled testing, with janky frames cut by roughly two-thirds.

## v4.3 — FolioOrb Goes Desktop

- **One-click desktop installers** — no Python, no terminal. Download a native app for
  [macOS (Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/releases/latest) or
  [Windows (x64)](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/releases/latest) and launch it
  like any other app. The FastAPI server runs in-process behind a native window
- **Automated release pipeline** — every tagged release builds, smoke-tests, and publishes
  the `.dmg` and `.exe` to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/udhawan97/FolioOrb/releases)
  with a `SHA256SUMS.txt`, so a broken build can never replace a good download
- **Rolling `latest-main` builds** — every merge to `main` refreshes a prerelease with the
  newest installers, available under "Development builds" on the site for early testers
- **Download-first website** — the [landing page](https://udhawan97.github.io/FolioOrb/)
  detects your OS, links straight to the current installer, and shows live release
  version, date, and checksums
- **Honest trust story** — early builds aren't code-signed yet, so the
  [install guides](https://udhawan97.github.io/FolioOrb/download/) walk through the
  expected macOS Gatekeeper / Windows SmartScreen warnings and how to verify your download
- **Local data stays put** — the installed app keeps your database and `.env` in the
  per-user data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/FolioOrb` on macOS,
  `%APPDATA%\FolioOrb` on Windows), never inside the app bundle

## v4.2 — Meet Senpai, and Never Get Lost on Day One

- **Senpai** — the dashboard orb formerly known as "dashboard pet" / "Portfolio Butler"
  is now named Senpai everywhere: ids, classes, JS, `localStorage`, and the visible label
- **Tips & tricks** — Senpai's quote rotation now surfaces genuinely useful one-liners
  (Research mode, hold-type icons, keyboard shortcuts) about 1 time in 4
- **First-run welcome guide** — a one-time modal on a fresh install with zero holdings,
  covering how to add a holding, what Research mode means, and what the four hold-type
  icons do — sourced straight from the same tooltips used elsewhere in the app
- **Docs site fix** — 5 internal links that 404'd on GitHub Pages (missing the site's
  base path) are fixed, and a **Documentation** link was added to the app's nav menu

## v4.1 — The Dashboard Finally Knows Its Own Key

- **In-dashboard API key configuration** — paste a Claude key from the nav, validated and
  written to `.env`, reconnected without a restart
- **Live token cost tracking** — the cost HUD now shows real accumulated input/output
  tokens and actual spend instead of a cache-based estimate
- **First-click holding expand** — rows expand their intelligence panel on the first
  click, with auto-refresh keeping prices current
- **Overview sector graph rework** — proportional weighted fills instead of absolute
  percentage bars, plus an overflow note when more sectors are held than the strip can show
- Assorted fixes: font resize regression, a scroll-interception bug, and ticker
  management now triggering a fresh quote load without a full reload
